Funding Program
Cluster Accelerator Program
The Cluster Accelerator Program is designed to fund projects that support Canada’s advanced manufacturing ecosystem and help strengthen collaboration among advanced manufacturing clusters across Canada.
Background &
Guidance Documents
Next Generation Manufacturing Canada (NGen), with a mission to build world-class advanced manufacturing capabilities in Canada for the benefit of Canadians, is pleased to announce the reopening of our funding support for Canadian manufacturing clusters.
Cluster Accelerator Funding support can be used to support projects covering one or more of the following types of projects:
Innovation Projects
– The objective of these projects is to promote the development and/or adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies.
Commercialization Projects
– The objective of these projects is to scope out strategic opportunities for supplier and business development, support commercialization and export readiness of cluster members, and/or facilitate participation in international export or investment missions.
Sustainability Projects
– The objective of these projects is to assist cluster members in improving environmental management, reducing GHG emissions, and/or strengthening domestic supply chain resilience.
Workforce and Management Enhancement Projects
– The objective of these projects is to support upskilling of their members’ workforce, attract young people and equity-seeking groups into careers in advanced manufacturing, develop new skills training end employee placement initiatives, enhance diversity and inclusion in Canada’s advanced manufacturing workforce, and/or position the cluster as a magnet for international talent attraction.
Network Projects
– The objective of these projects is to support collaborative initiatives among two or more clusters in pursuit of innovation, commercialization, sustainability, or workforce and management enhancement objectives.
Cluster applications can be from a new or existing not-for-profit industry led organization/cluster representing SMEs (small/medium enterprises, defined as less than five hundred employees) in a region, sector, or both. Start-up Cluster Accelerator Funding projects require a minimum of five SMEs coming together to form a new cluster that will continue to drive forward the Canadian advanced manufacturing ecosystem. All applicants are encouraged to demonstrate support for a well-rounded ecosystem including industry, academia, research, government agencies, and service companies.
Individual cluster organizations can apply for up to $100,000 per year with an industry match of 150% of cash and/or in-kind contribution per application. Multiple clusters bidding on a collaborative project can apply for up to $75,000 per cluster. The duration of each Cluster Accelerator Funding project is 12 months.
