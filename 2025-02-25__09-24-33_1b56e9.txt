For all other institutions, the Mitacs Elevate program’s policy is to take no position regarding the intellectual property created by the projects and fellowships that are funded.
Intellectual property is left to be shared between the university, its researchers, and the industry partner, according to the intellectual property rules of the host university, unless a separate agreement is negotiated between the university, its researchers, and the industry partner. Mitacs strongly recommends that any discussions pertaining to intellectual property and confidentiality – where relevant – be resolved prior to submitting the Mitacs Elevate proposal.
All Mitacs Elevate fellowship proposals undergo a two-stage review process:
Stage 1:
an administrative review to confirm program eligibility, followed by
Stage 2:
an external review based on peer assessment of the research project proposals.
Peer assessment criteria are grouped into two (2) broad categories: the technical merit of the proposed research project; and the excellence of the proposed fellow.  For these categories, Mitacs seeks arm’s length expert reviewers to answer the following questions:
A. Technical merit of the proposed project
Does the project significantly contribute to the advancement of knowledge or the development of new applications, and is there an appreciable element of novelty?
Are the objectives achievable, given the current state of the art and the expertise of the project team?
Are the methods and techniques appropriate for the objectives?
Is the proposed project at an appropriate level for a postdoctoral fellow
B. Excellence of the proposed fellow
Relative to other researchers at the same career stage, how would you characterize the achievements of the proposed fellow (e.g. publication record, patents, awards and scholarships, mentoring, accomplishments in teaching, related industry or entrepreneurial activities, etc.)?
The Elevate program offers training opportunities to develop leadership, communication and business skills. Does the candidate demonstrate commitment to this professional development?

FAQs
Before You Apply
When You Apply
After You Apply
During Your Fellowship
Are part-time postdoctoral fellows eligible?
In order to participate in any Mitacs program, it is preferred that interns have full-time student or postdoc status at their academic institution. However, individuals with part-time status as postdoctoral fellows are also eligible for Elevate, provided that the following conditions hold:
• They have postdoctoral fellow status at the academic institution for the duration of the fellowship
• They are covered under the institution’s insurance, the same as full-time postdocs
• The institution is able to pay the fellow a salary or stipend from the Mitacs grant
• The fellow is able to commit to the project for the appropriate two-year duration
Are partner organization funds that are matched by other organizations eligible for Elevate?
No. Funds used towards Elevate cannot be matched by any other federal or provincial agency.
Can a fellow who has not yet defended their PhD by the application deadline still apply?
Yes, they can apply; however, they must have fulfilled all PhD degree requirements (e.g., successful defense, final deposit and sign off of dissertation) and must clearly demonstrate that their PhD will be received by their project start date. In addition to having completed their PhD, students must hold postdoctoral status at their host academic institution by the start date and for up to two years while in the Elevate program or they will be ineligible to receive the award. No funds will be transferred to award recipients without postdoctoral status.
Can a partner organization contribute more than $30,000 per year?
Yes. Partner organizations are welcome to contribute additional funding but Mitacs will not provide any additional funding outside of the standard award. This additional partner funding should be included in the application budget, recommendation letter and the anticipated use of funds (e.g. stipend/salary top-up, specialized equipment). Top-up funds must be received at Mitacs at the same time as the minimum contribution and will be added to the annual award and forwarded to the academic institution.
Can an academic supervisor be an adjunct professor or an assistant professor?
Any professor who holds a faculty position at a Canadian academic institution is eligible to administer Tri-Council funds, and is in a position that allows them to supervise graduate students at the host academic institution may act as an academic supervisor. Please contact your academic institution to determine if they have specific regulations in this regard.
Can Mitacs allow for virtual interaction with partner organizations and academic institutions?
Direct interaction and supervision by the partner organization for a portion of the internship is a key feature of Mitacs’s Accelerate, BSI and Elevate programs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mitacs required that interns spend time on site at the partner organization to benefit from this interaction and supervision. Now that the technology to enable virtual work has greatly improved and many workplaces have hybrid or fully virtual operations, Mitacs will continue to allow interaction with the partner organization in our internship programs to take place virtually as well as in person.
When writing their application, participants should focus on the nature of the interaction with the partner and plan for high-quality interaction and supervision regardless of whether it takes place in person, virtually or hybrid. Mitacs still encourages on-site interaction at the partner when it is logistically feasible.
* Note that Globalink are international mobility programs. For this reason, travel and time spent on site with collaborators are still required in these programs.
Can the partner organization be a not-for-profit?
Under the Mitacs Elevate program, partner organizations must be:
• a for-profit Canadian corporation
• the Canadian business location of a foreign-owned for-profit corporation with significant Canadian operations
• a not-for-profit corporation, such as an economic development organization, an industry association, a charitable organization, or a social-welfare organization in Canada. Please contact
elevate@mitacs.ca
to discuss the eligibility of a specific not-for-profit organization before submission of the completed application package.
• a hospital or municipality in Canada. Please contact
elevate@mitacs.ca
to discuss the eligibility of projects with hospitals, or municipalities before submission of the completed application package
Partners should be potential end users of the research, with a vested interest in the results.
Does a student need to be a recent PhD to apply?
No, but applicants should have completed their PhD within the last five years. Students should contact
elevate@mitacs.ca
before applying and provide their CV so Mitacs can assess their eligibility.
If an academic supervisor must contribute funds, how is this administered?
If a student’s situation requires an annual $5,000 contribution from their academic supervisor, Mitacs requires confirmation of these funds at the time of the application (budget section of the proposal form). Funds are not required to come directly to Mitacs.
If they are successful, their academic institution will be required to indicate the account number the funds are in, and that the academic institution is prepared to report on the funds, as part of the fellowship funding, with a Form 300 or annual statement of account outlining the use of funds to support the fellow. This confirmation will be sent with a Provisional Notice of Award at the time the results are announced.
If there’s no need for a student to go to the partner organization’s facilities, are they allowed to do all the research at their academic institution?
In-person interaction at the partner’s location is required when feasible, but we recognize that due to pandemic restrictions, many organizations and academic institutions began working virtually as much as possible, and that this mode of work may continue in some fields as part of the new normal. If the partner organization does not have a physical location where a student can interact with their staff, students should explain this, and be sure to clearly describe their plans for virtual interaction. If a student expects to interact virtually due to the current pandemic situation, but may be able to go to the partner organization in person later in the fellowship, also mention these plans.
In this section, describe the nature of the planned interaction (whether it will be in-person, virtual, or both) with all parties (for example both the academic supervisor and the partner organization).
• Which parts of the project will be conducted on site at the partner organization and/or at the academic institution?
• Describe the interaction with and supervision by employees of the partner organization. If the interaction will be virtual, how will the fellow be exposed to the activities and culture of the partner organization (e.g., team meetings, company events, virtual coffee chats, training activities, etc.)?
• Provide details of the resources (physical or virtual) and expertise to be shared by partner staff.
Load More
Can a student use their research costs to offset their relocation costs?
Relocation costs for eligible research personnel and their immediate family members are typically eligible expenses. Eligible expenses in support of the research must be budgeted and agreed upon by all parties (postdoctoral fellow, academic supervisor, and partner organization) at the time of the proposal and be detailed on the application form. These funds are limited to supporting the direct costs of research. Please refer to the Mitacs Use of Funds policy (found in the downloadable General Mitacs Terms, Conditions & Policies zip file under How to Apply) for details of eligible expenses for Mitacs programs.
Does the fellow need to be identified at the time of application?
Yes. If you are a professor and you are interested in a project with a partner organization but have not yet identified a fellow, you may want to consider applying for the
Mitacs Accelerate
program instead.
How long does the fellowship last?
The Mitacs Elevate program is a one or two-year program.
Postdocs can complete nine internship units (typically 3 years) of Mitacs funding, including any combination of Elevate & Accelerate in any order (e.g. Accelerate after an Elevate; hold more than one Elevate). One year of Elevate counts as 3 internship units.
If a project requires ethics/animal care/biohazard review, does the student have to submit the approval from the academic institution review committee with their application?
No, the approval is not required by the application deadline, but a valid academic institution Research Ethics Board/University Animal Care Committee/Biohazard certification or approval is required for the research activities contained in the Elevate proposal, in accordance with the requirements of the federal granting agencies. Mitacs may request a copy of the report to ensure compliance.
Is there a template for the CV?
We do have a template that is used for the Mitacs Accelerate program; however, sending your CV in a template is not necessary for this application.
How many fellowships will be awarded?
The Mitacs Elevate Review Committee will decide the number of fellowship awards at the time of the review, dependent upon quality of submissions and available funding.
When can students start the fellowship?
Fellowship may begin any time after the acceptance notice is received. Mitacs
can
not release an award until we receive partner funds, and your fellowship should not
sta
rt
before the award letter has been received by your institution.
Can a fellow change their academic supervisor, academic institution and/or partner organization for the second year of the fellowship?
Requests to change the academic supervisor, academic institution and/or organization partner will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Applicants requesting such a change will be asked to provide a clear and satisfactory justification. Impacts on the research project and learning environments (academic and partner organization) will be assessed to ensure a high-quality experience for the fellow.
Can a partner organization submit payments of their contribution funds in installments?
We request that the contribution funds be sent in a single installment. If there are extenuating circumstances in which a partner organization is not able to pay in one installment, please contact Mitacs.
Can fellows take Parental Leave while in the program?
Yes. This should be communicated to their academic supervisor, organization partner and academic institution. Their fellowship will be put on hold for this period of time, and they will not be paid from your fellowship. Once a return date has been determined, they will need to inform Mitacs of when they plan on returning to the fellowship to complete their term. A Request for Leave form (found in the downloadable Application Package zip file in the How To Apply section) must be submitted to
elevate@mitacs.ca
to request to put the fellowship on hold.
Does Mitacs require Form 300s / Statements of Account from the academic institutions at the end of each Elevate fellowship?
Yes. The academic institution must provide a Form 300 / Statement of Account (separate Form 300s / Statements of Account for each account, if applicable) for funds received by the supervisor for each fiscal year (April 1 to March 31) and the form(s) should be sent to Mitacs Inc. no later than May 31. Please note that if a balance is left in the account as of March 31, a separate Form 300 / Statement of Account for the following fiscal year is required, detailing how the remaining funds were spent. At the end of the fellowship, a Form 300 / Statement of Account with a zero balance is required within 30 days of the award end date, detailing how the remaining funds were spent. The academic supervisor as well as the academic institution Finance Officer must sign the Form 300 / Statement of Account and the form with original signatures must be sent to Mitacs.
If a fellow cannot complete the full term of their Mitacs Elevate fellowship, what is the procedure for returning the unused contribution funds to their academic supervisor/partner organization?
If a fellow plans to terminate their award early, they will need to send a written notice to Mitacs, including the reasons for such action and the effective termination date, to
elevate@mitacs.ca
. Their host academic institution will be required to return any prorated funds for the remainder of the fellowship. Once the academic institution returns these unused funds to Mitacs, we will issue a refund to the fellow’s partner organization for the prorated amount of their contribution. These funds are limited to supporting the direct costs of research. Refer to Mitacs Use of Funds policy for details of eligible expenses for Mitacs programs.
An Early Cancellation of Fellowship form (found in the downloadable Application Package zip file in the How To Apply section) must be submitted to
elevate@mitacs.ca
in order to officially cancel the fellowship.
Is the Elevate award a stipend or a salary? Will benefits be deducted?
Elevate is offered in partnership with your academic institution, which administers the award. We recommend that students speak with their academic supervisor and institution about postdoc status (“employees” or “trainees”), funding policies (“stipend” or “salary”), and potential deductions of benefits. Academic institutions administer funds according to their individual institutional policies, which are flexible under Tri-Council guidelines. If benefits are included, they may be deducted from either the fellow’s pay or the accompanying research funds.
What does the professional development component for Elevate involve?
The professional development component offered to Elevate postdoctoral fellow are organized into eight course bundles, featuring eight online self-paced courses and seven online instructor-led workshops. These workshops are led by top business and industry professionals selected through a competitive process. Our facilitators are experts in their fields, providing hands-on, engaging, and experiential learning.
Courses and workshops are free for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows registered at Mitacs partner colleges and universities in Canada. The curriculum is designed to build competencies in five key areas essential for professional success, with each course addressing one or more of the following:
Professional & career fundamentals
Interpersonal skills
Communication
Leadership & management
Intrapreneurialism
When must the partner contribution be received at Mitacs?
Invoices must be paid in full to Mitacs prior to any internship funds being sent by Mitacs to the university. Please note that all partner funds must be sent directly to Mitacs and not to the university. The funds must be received in advance of the internship start date.
