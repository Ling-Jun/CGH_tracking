Regional Artificial Intelligence Initiative (RAII) for Northern OntarioArtificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that has the potential to transform the economy across all industries in Canada. It holds tremendous economic potential in terms of commercialization, innovation, productivity and competitiveness, and has the potential to generate a range of social and environmental benefits for Canadians. The global race to scale up and adoptAIis on, and Canada is at the forefront of this technology. As part of Budget 2024, the Government of Canada has allocated $200 million to Canada'sregional development agencies(RDAs) to help bring newAItechnologies to market and help accelerateAIadoption in critical sectors such as agriculture, health sciences, manufacturing, mining supply and service and forestry.TheRegional Artificial Intelligence Initiative (RAII)will help bridge the gap between cutting-edgeAIresearch and broader marketplace consumption with support spanning two pillars:AIproductization and commercialization– SupportAIscale-ups address common challenges on their journey from lab prototypes to real-world applications, including securing growth capital, talent acquisition, data management, and navigating regulatory and business conduct frameworks.Adoption ofAIapplications– Support will addressAIadoption lag among small and medium-sized enterprises. Support will focus on addressing challenges, such as skills gaps,AIintegration complexities, and compliance with regulatory and industry standards.Expected resultsProjects supported through the RAII program will work towards achieving one or both of the following departmental results:Businesses and organizations in Northern Ontario are investing in the adoption and commercialization of innovative technologies;
