Canada's Regional Development Agencies
From: Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada
Canada's regional development agencies (RDA) are providing $50 million through the Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative to help businesses enhance homebuilding supply chains and advance innovation in the residential construction sector. Part of Canada's Housing Plan, these investments will help change the way houses are built across the country, helping give more Canadians a place to call home, faster.
Canada's Regional Development Agencies (RDA) work closely with businesses and innovators in their regions to fuel economic growth that creates more well-paying middle-class jobs for Canadians.
Canada's regional development agencies (RDA) are a key part of the Government of Canada's Innovation and Skills Plan, advancing and diversifying our regional economies and helping communities thrive. There are seven RDAs across Canada:
