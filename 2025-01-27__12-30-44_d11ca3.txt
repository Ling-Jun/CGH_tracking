Canada's Regional Development Agencies
From:
Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada
Canada's regional development agencies (RDA) are providing $50 million through the Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative to help businesses enhance homebuilding supply chains and advance innovation in the residential construction sector. Part of
Canada's Housing Plan
