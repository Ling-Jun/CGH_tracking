Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative
Part of the REGI program
Increasing the housing supply is a priority for the Government of Canada. Delivered by Canada’s regional development agencies, the Regional Homebuilding Innovation Initiative (RHII) provides for one-time funding of $50 million up to March 31, 2026, to develop innovative manufacturing solutions to accelerate the construction of multi-unit residential housing across the country.
In Quebec, the RHII has a budget of $10.45M in funding for one-time, targeted regional support for manufacturing SMEs and NPOs that develop innovative solutions for the multi-unit residential construction sector and its supply chain
The RHII complements funding offered by other federal, provincial and territorial programs. It contributes to Canada’s Housing Plan aimed at resolving the housing crisis by easing access to housing for all Canadians.
