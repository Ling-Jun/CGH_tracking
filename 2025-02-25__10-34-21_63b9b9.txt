It’s often hard to know even where to start.To simplify the process, we’ve teamed up with key partners to create the Alberta Indigenous Clean Energy Initiative (AICEI).AICEIhelps First Nations and Métis communities get the most out of their investments in clean energy projects.We’re open to discussions at any stage. Depending on where your project is at, we can help you:identify your community’s priorities;explore potential opportunities and partnerships;develop your capacity to lead clean energy projects;see your projects through to completion;provide funding to support your project;identify other funding sources that are a better fit.We also regularly host webinars, so even if you just want to learn a bit more about clean energy, just let us know and we’ll be sure to let you know whenever they occur.TheAICEIis funded throughthe Strategic Partnerships Initiative, led by Indigenous Services Canada.Example project typesTheAICEIcan support renewable energy generation or energy efficiency projects that are led by, or for the benefit of, First Nation and Métis communities in Alberta.
