Community Readiness and Opportunities Planning (CROP)
The Community Readiness and Opportunities Planning (CROP) program is one of two program contribution streams of the
Northern Indigenous Economic Opportunities Program (NIEOP)
.
CROP works to improve the economic development capacity of Indigenous communities and increase economic development in the three territories. It achieves this by providing financial support to First Nations, Inuit,
MÃ©tis
and non-status Indigenous communities so they can improve their capacity and prepare to plan for, pursue, and participate in economic opportunities.
The objective of
CROP
is to:
Increase community employment
Enhance the use and increase the value of resources under the control of the community
Generate more community government revenue from economic development
Enhance community economic development and other infrastructure
Develop opportunities to access resources that are not under the control of the community
Generate more investments in the community
Create a better climate and environment for community economic development
Generate more and larger community businesses
Produce more contracts and sales for community businesses
Increase capacity within community governments to seize future economic development opportunities
