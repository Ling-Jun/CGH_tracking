On the path to  net-zero, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is committed to building meaningful  partnerships and ensuring Indigenous peoples benefit from funding opportunities  that can contribute to our shared fight against climate change.To help  address challenges related to awareness, understanding, and confidence in  zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), lower-carbon trucks, and clean fuels, NRCan is piloting  a continuous intake call for proposals for Indigenous-led projects that address  these barriers to adoption.This  call for proposals has a notionalfunding allocation of up to $4.5 million,  and projects must be completed by no later than March 31, 2026.Areas of focusZero-Emission Vehicles AwarenessSupport for projects that aim to increase awareness,  knowledge, and public confidence in:zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) in medium and heavy-duty vehicle classeslow-emitting medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (trucks, delivery vans) including retrofits,       repowers, and conversionsNOTE:Funding for light-duty (personal) zero-emission vehicle projects and public charging and refuelling technologies projects is now fully committed, so no additional projects related to this area can be funded under this pilotClean Fuels AwarenessSupport for projects that increase knowledge and  understanding about the opportunities, benefits, and considerations related to  adopting clean fuels in industrial operations, across the economy, and for  consumers.
