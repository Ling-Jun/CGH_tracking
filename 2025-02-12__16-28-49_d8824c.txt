How are funding decisions made for the Core project streams?
Across all programs, Canada’s Ocean Supercluster engages independent experts to assess projects and make recommendations for approval. The OSC employs a robust Conflict of Interest policy in the assessment of projects at each phase.
With a project portfolio of approximately 90 collaborative ocean projects that contribute to the health and productivity of our ocean, projects range in value from under a million dollars to tens of millions of dollars, where Canada’s Ocean Supercluster co-invests with industry to bring the project to fruition. Projects often involve a range of partners from SMEs, larger more mature companies, academia, regional innovation hubs, Indigenous partners, and others.
