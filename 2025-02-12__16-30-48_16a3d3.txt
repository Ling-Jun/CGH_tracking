About the program
The Indigenous Leadership Fund is a program under the Low Carbon Economy Fund. It provides up to $180 million by 2029 to support climate action by Indigenous peoples. The program funds Indigenous-owned and led renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low-carbon heating projects. These projects will help meet Canada’s 2030 emissions reduction target and net-zero emissions by 2050. This is a key part of the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan.
Recognizing the unique rights, interests, and circumstances of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis governments, communities, and organizations, the Indigenous Leadership Fund uses a distinctions-based approach to deliver funding to support projects that:
are Indigenous-owned and led
advance Indigenous climate leadership
support the self-determined climate, social, and economic priorities of Indigenous peoples
As announced in Budget 2022, up to $32.2 million will go to the Atlin Hydro Expansion project, which will provide clean electricity to the Yukon and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Funding streams
Environment and Climate Change Canada is delivering the program using a distinctions-based approach and is working and communicating directly with Indigenous governments, communities, and organizations to deliver funding to support projects. The three distinctions-based funding streams are:
First Nations
Inuit
Métis
A designated funding stream for eligible applicants not already included in the funding streams for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis is also available.
First Nations
Important notice
Due to high demand and limited funding, the First Nations funding stream is currently closed and not accepting new applications. If you have already submitted an Expression of Interest or project proposal, you will be contacted directly with an update on the status of your application.
The First Nations funding stream is spending up to $73.9 million. It was developed in collaboration with First Nation representatives and Indigenous clean energy experts. The stream is intended for First Nations governments, communities, and organizations, including First Nations tribal or band councils, Modern Treaty and Self-Governing First Nations, First Nations-owned businesses and corporations, First Nations not-for-profit organizations, etc.
The call for proposals can fund a variety of project types and sizes, with a maximum ECCC contribution of $6 million per project. The stream supports First Nation-owned and First Nation-led renewable energy, energy efficiency, or low-carbon heating projects that provide benefits to First Nations. Eligible projects must be past the concept stage and ready for deployment or construction, meaning that project planning and pre-feasibility activities have been completed, other funding has been secured or is close to being secured, and partnership agreements, impact or environmental assessments, permitting requirements, and power purchase agreements have been finalized or are near finalization.
Proposals that include non-First Nation partners must provide transparent and comprehensive information on the ownership and governance structure of the project, including details on decision-making processes.
Inuit
This funding stream was developed in collaboration with the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and four Inuit land claim organizations. It is delivered through a directed and continuous intake process over six years, starting in 2023. Each Inuit land claim organization is developing a portfolio of projects to access the funding they have been allocated.
Funding under the Inuit stream is available for the following Inuit land claim organizations:
Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated
The Makivvik Corporation of Nunavik
The Nunatsiavut Government
The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation
Métis
This funding stream was developed in collaboration with the Métis National Council and five Métis governments. It is delivered through a directed and continuous intake process over six years, starting in 2023. Each Métis government is developing a portfolio of projects to access the funding they have been allocated. Funding allocations have been determined using the Métis National Council’s funding formula.
