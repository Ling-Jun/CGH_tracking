Clean Power
Oneida Energy Storage
Clean Power infrastructure reduces emissions, creates skilled employment and enables Canadians to access more reliable and sustainable energy.
Clean power is particularly important in addressing the infrastructure gap in Indigenous and northern communities and to increase our energy security nationwide. New investment is required to improve electricity interties and advance clean power generation, distribution and use.
Our innovative low-cost financing opportunities can help address gaps in the capital structure of projects such as renewables, district energy systems, energy storage and more.
