See our general FAQs.See our FAQ pageWhat is the Indigenous Entrepreneur Startup Program?The Indigenous Entrepreneur Startup Program (IESP) is a tailored program equipped with tools, resources, financing and mentorship to support the needs of young Indigenous entrepreneurs across the country while launching their full-time business in the first year of operations.Why does Futurpreneur have a specific program supporting Indigenous entrepreneursIndigenous entrepreneurs face barriers and realities that are only specific and relevant to Indigenous communities. We recognize and acknowledge that equity deserving groups should have access to applicable and culturally appropriate programming and services in order to empower success.How is the Indigenous Entrepreneur Startup Program different from your other programs?Our IESP team is comprised entirely of Indigenous professionals from all over Canada. As we are part of the Indigenous community, we understand the Indigenous clients we work with and the realities they encounter. All of our learning content is created and delivered by an Indigenous team, incorporates Indigenous worldviews and histories, and is made accessible to all Indigenous clients wherever they may be.We have also made adjustments to our credit matrix for equitable accessibility to our financing and mentorship program for Indigenous entrepreneurs, recognizing that many Indigenous individuals experience credit barriers and disadvantages due to colonialism.Who is eligible for the Indigenous Entrepreneur Startup Program?Any self-identifying Indigenous entrepreneur, in their first year of business, between the ages of 18-39, with a Futurpreneur eligible business model, and a qualified credit standing is eligible for the Indigenous Entrepreneur Startup Program.To participate in this program, how is a person determined to be Indigenous?As we aim to not create additional barriers for Indigenous entrepreneurs, while also recognizing that Indigenous identity is individual and multi-faceted, we determine Indigenous identity through self identification. Intersectionality is also welcomed (e.g., those who identify as Black and Indigenous are eligible for this program).Financing terms & feesFuturpreneur repayment terms & feesUp to $25,000 with a term over five years.Interest is charged at CIBC’s prime rate + 3%.
