Financial support for technology innovation through NRC IRAPFuel your innovationIf you're a small or medium‑sized Canadian business pursuing technology‑driven innovation, you may be eligible for financial support from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP). We provide this funding to eligible firms under our technology innovation projects and youth employment strategy programs.NRC IRAP provides funding to support research and development projects at various stages of the innovation cycle. In 2018‑2019, NRC IRAP was mandated to expand its support to include an increased funding threshold of up to $10 million for larger research and development projects. This increased funding support will make it easier for small and medium‑sized Canadian businesses to access the support they need to grow and expand their companies.Working as an extension of traditional NRC IRAP support, the additional funding for larger research and development projects is targeted toward firms that will have demonstrated to the program the ability to grow rapidly and significantly. These firms will be identified by NRC IRAP with the objective to help recipients of this increased funding threshold achieve transformative growth within 5 years of completing their project and, in so doing, significantly benefit Canada's economy.Am I eligible for financial support?If you meet the following criteria, connect with NRC IRAP by calling1-877-994-4727to find out if your business is eligible for NRC IRAP support:you are an incorporated, profit-oriented small or medium-sized business in Canadayou have 500 or fewer full-time equivalent employeesyou plan to pursue growth and profit by developing and commercializing innovative, technology-driven new or improved products, services or processes in CanadaTo assist us in undertaking preliminary due diligence of your firm to be considered for NRC IRAP support, please have available:a business plan or pitch decka copy of your company financialsresumes or biographies for each member of the management team and technical team on staffWhat happens next?If we determine that NRC IRAP support could benefit your development and growth strategies, we will refer you to an industrial technology advisor (ITA).Understanding your businessYour ITA may meet with you in person to understand your business in more detail, including your business strategy, the issues you face, opportunities for growth and your plans for the future.
