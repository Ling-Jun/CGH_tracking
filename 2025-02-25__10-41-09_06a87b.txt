Greening Government Fund
The Government of Canada is committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and delivering a low-carbon, climate resilient and clean growth economy. The Greening Government Fund, created in 2019, is one component of  The Greening Government Strategy, which outlines the plan to reduce GHG emissions and broader scope greening actions for federal operations.
The fund targets projects that not only reduce GHG emissions in federal operations, but are innovative, can be reproduced across the government, or that pursue solutions in areas where GHGs may be difficult to reduce. Funding comes from departments and agencies that generate more than 1 kilotonne of GHGs per year from air travel or that have voluntarily contributed to the fund.
Projects vary greatly but include adopting clean technologies – things like developing smart building competencies or enhancing aircraft aerodynamics, increasing green procurement tools, or implementing renewable electricity initiatives.
As of January 2025, the Greening Government Fund has approved approximately $60 million in funding for projects that reduce GHGs in government operations.

Eliminate fossil fuels from all ground maintenance activities by replacing gas and diesel-powered grounds maintenance equipment with zero-emission mowers and electric hand tools. The projects results will effectively reduce GHG emissions from PEIs ground maintenance activities, reduce noise and operational cost and will facilitate similar transitions for other Parks Canada administered locations.

Low Embodied Carbon Materials for Standardized Forced Entry and Ballistic Resistance
Develop and test standards for low-carbon materials that meet the government’s forced entry and ballistic resistance security requirements. The project’s results will help reduce the embodied carbon associated with the construction of secure areas within RCMP detachments and other secure government facilities.

Case Study of Wood vs. Concrete Building for the Canada Revenue Agency Building in Shawinigan, Quebec
Conduct a case study and life cycle assessment of the Canada Revenue Building in Shawinigan, Quebec to compare the climate impacts of wood construction with traditional concrete design and construction. The project will define the regional reference carbon footprint for wood construction products and consider solutions for increasing its use in large building projects.

Hydrogen Utilization for Canadian Coast Guard Vessels
Provide Canadian Coast Guard with data on the technological feasibility of hydrogen (and select hydrogen carriers) as a fuel to deliver fleet emission reductions. The study will analyze hydrogen-based technology solutions as well as other factors to understand whether it is feasible, efficient and safe to incorporate hydrogen technology into Canadian Coast Guard operations.

Feasibility Study on Forest Residue Gasification
Conduct a feasibility study and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to assess forest residue gasification scenarios at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier. The results of this project would support a low carbon energy production solution to meet peak demand. The project also includes the development of calculation and analysis tools to enable other departments and provinces to conduct similar feasibility studies.

M Division Headquarters (MHQ) Life Cycle Building Assessment
Complete a GHG reduction and life cycle cost analysis for the existing RCMP’s M Division Headquarters in Whitehorse, Yukon. The project’s results could be applied to older buildings in Whitehorse similar to the MHQ, and therefore reduce Yukon’s dependence on oil / propane.
