Greening Government FundThe Greening Government Fund was established as part of the Government of Canada’s response to climate change. This initiative:provides project funding to federal government departments and agencies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in their operationspromotes and shares innovative approaches to reducing GHGsThe fund targets projects that:are anticipated to reduce GHG emissions in federal operationstest or implement innovative approachescan be reproduced within or across departmentspursue solutions in areas where GHGs are difficult to reduceProject funding comes from departments and agencies that generate more than 1 kilotonne of GHGs per year from air travel and from departments that are below this threshold and contribute voluntarily. Only departments and agencies that contribute to the fund are eligible to access it.As of January 2024, the Greening Government Fund has approved more than $55 million in funding for projects that reduce GHGs in government operations.ProjectsFiltering OptionsFiltering optionsUse the filters below to change the focus of your results.DepartmentAll departmentsAgriculture and Agri-food CanadaCanada Revenue AgencyCanadian Space AgencyCanadian Coast GuardCrown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs CanadaDefence Research and Development CanadaDepartment of National DefenceEnvironment and Climate Change CanadaFisheries and Oceans CanadaGlobal Affairs CanadaHealth CanadaInnovation, Science and Economic Development CanadaNational Research Council CanadaNatural Resources CanadaParks Canada AgencyPublic Services and Procurement CanadaRoyal Canadian Mounted PoliceShared Services CanadaTransport CanadaTreasury Board of Canada SecretariatCategoryAll categoriesReal PropertyFleetOtherProcurementCompletion dateAll years2026202520242023202220212020FilterClearProject TitleDescriptionDepartmentFundingCategoryCompletion DateOngoing Commissioning (OCx) Demonstration ProjectsPilot Ongoing Commissioning (OCx), a process of continuously monitoring and optimizing building performance, in 3 different federal buildings.
