Natural disasters:Â Important information about repaying your loan
The Canada Apprentice Loan is an initiative of the Government of Canada to help you complete your apprenticeship in a
designated Red Seal trade
.
With the Canada Apprentice Loan, you can get up to $4,000 in interest-free loans per period of technical training.  You can use the money to help pay for tuition, tools, equipment and living expenses, to cover forgone wages or to help support your family.
In-training support
You will not have to make payments on your Canada Apprentice Loan, and no interest will accumulate until after you complete or leave your apprenticeship training program.
The Canada Apprentice Loan is available in all provinces and territories except Quebec, where an
alternate support
is available.
