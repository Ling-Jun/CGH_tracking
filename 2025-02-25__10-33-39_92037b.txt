It offers interest-free, repayable funding to incorporated businesses.* Definition of a “high-growth business”A high growth business can be defined as any for-profit company that has notable and/or consistent revenue increases year-over-year. Priority will normally be given to companies with 20% year-over-year revenue growth.Here are examples of a high-growth business:Example 1:ABC is an innovative Canadian medical devices firm. ABC is a relatively young company operating in North America and would like to expand its product into new markets like Europe and Asia. ABC has generated significant sales growth (such as 26% year-over-year). ABC has profitable reinvestment opportunities and, rather than paying dividends to shareholders, decides to reinvest earnings back into the firm to capitalize on its investment opportunities in order to maintain this high sales growth.Example 2:XYZ is an innovative Canadian digital software developer. XYZ is a young company operating in Canada and the USA but would like to introduce its new software, which is in the late stage of development, in order to grow and diversify existing Canadian and American markets. XYZ has generated significant sales growth (such as 22% year over year). XYZ has recently received a round of investments that will assist with its growth.On this pageEligibilityAvailable fundingEligible costsIneligible costsExpected outcomesFunding disbursementRepayment termsFunding decisionsApplication processHow to submit an expression of interestAfter submitting an expression of interestApplication reviewElements of a strong proposalContactsEligibilityTheBSPprogram is open to incorporated high-growth businesses that have been operating in the Prairie Provinces for a minimum of 2 years.
