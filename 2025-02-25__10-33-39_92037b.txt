Funding disbursement
PrairiesCan provides funding based on submitted claims.
PrairiesCan will reimburse based on approved portion (in other words 50%) of eligible project costs that have been incurred and paid.
Other funding considerations
Consult your accountant and/or Canada Revenue Agency to determine the full implications of receiving BSP funding (such as taxable income, Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentive Program (SR&ED) tax credits)
SR&ED credits or other similar federal or provincial tax credits expected to be received within the project scope/timeline for project activities will be considered to be other government assistance. This may require PrairiesCan to reduce its funding to maintain the level of government assistance at 50%.
Where possible, exclude SR&ED eligible costs from your application.

After project completion, there is a 1 year grace period, followed by equal monthly payments over 5 years.
Interest-free; no security/collateral will be taken.
There is no penalty for early repayment.
Funding decisions
Within approximately 90 business days of receiving a complete funding application. Refer to PrairiesCan’s service standards.
One successful BSP project per organization per calendar year.
Application process
The BSP program uses a 2-stage continuous intake approach to which applicants may apply at any time:
Expression of interest (EOI): This abbreviated on-line application form lets applicants describe the proposed project purpose, rationale, eligibility, activities and budget. We use it to determine if a project should advance to a full application.
Full application: If a project advances to the second stage, we invite the applicant to provide more details about their project through our online portal.
We encourage you to contact us prior to submitting an EOI. A PrairiesCan officer would be happy to answer your questions.
