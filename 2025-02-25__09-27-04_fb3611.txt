On April 25, 2022, the Ministers of Natural Ressources Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, and Indigenous Services Canada announced a federal investment of $300 million to further support clean energy projects in Indigenous, rural, and remote communities as part of Canada’s Strengthened Climate Plan. The additional $300 million is available through 2027 for your clean energy projects, subject to available funds. These projects can help advance Indigenous-led climate action, support local economic development and create skilled jobs while reducing pollution and improving air quality.

Our programs and initiatives
Please note: Due to high demand, the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program under Wah-ila-toos is no longer accepting applications for:
Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities Capacity Building projects
Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities – Deployment of renewable energy projects
Note that capacity building and deployment projects in the North are eligible under Northern REACHE.
Eligible projects submitted to these funding streams before September 15, 2023, have been added to a waitlist and will be considered for funding should funds be made available in the future. Our Pathfinding support may also assist with finding alternative funding options.
Wah-ila-toos is still accepting applications under:
Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities – Biomass heating, district heating, and combined heat and power systems
Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Energy program (Northern REACHE).
Please note: Due to high demand, remaining funding for this stream is limited, eligible projects received will be added to a waitlist, should funds become available:
Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities – Research, Development, and Demonstration projects
If you are unsure which stream your application fits within, please submit a contact form and we will be in touch to discuss. Please continue to visit this website for further updates.
We have streamlined the application process for our initiative by using one application form for all of our programs. You can submit one application to access NRCan’s Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities program (CERRC) and/or CIRNAC’s Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Energy program (REACHE) through the Clean Energy Initiatives for Indigenous, rural and communities contact form.
Clean Energy in Rural and Remote Communities (CERRC)
Funding for renewable energy and capacity building projects and related energy efficiency measures in Indigenous, rural and remote communities across Canada.
Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Electricity program (Northern REACHE)
Funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects and capacity building and planning for heating and electricity in Northern communities.
Indigenous Off-Diesel Initiative (IODI)
