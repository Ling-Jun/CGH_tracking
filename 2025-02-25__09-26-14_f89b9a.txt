To do this, it will be essential to overcome the barrier of the upfront capital investment that industry requires to develop new clean fuel production facilities and increase capacity.We recognize the unique opportunity clean fuels present for Indigenous businesses and communities and encourage Indigenous participation on all projects. We have designed a distinct process with measures to increase funding of Indigenous-led clean production capacity projects in Canada.The Clean Fuels Fund provides Indigenous-led projects with cost-shared, conditionally repayable funding. This financial support aims to help build new clean fuel production facilities or retrofit or expand existing ones in Canada.Additionally, the fund provides non-repayable funding for feasibility studies, basic engineering studies and detailed front-end engineering studies for new facilities, expansions or conversions of existing facilities. These measures will help accelerate the growth and development of the domestic clean fuels industry.We encourage you to review thefrequently asked questionsfor additional information.Who can apply?To be considered for funding under the program, applicants must be legal entities validly incorporated or registered in Canada including not-for-profit and for-profit organizations that can demonstrate a minimum of 50% Indigenous ownership.Program benefitsFunding the build-out of Indigenous-led production capacity projects will:grow the domestic production capacity for clean  fuelsincluding  clean hydrogen, advanced biofuels, renewable natural gas, and sustainable  aviation fuel, across Canadaoffer new opportunities for Canada’s energy sectorin the transition to producing cleaner sources of energysupport Canada’s efforts to reach net-zeroby 2050Contact usEmail theClean Fuels FundsStay connectedDate modified:2025-02-11
