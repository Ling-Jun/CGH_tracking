Canada’s clean fuels industry must significantly increase its current capacity to fulfill its critical role in achieving our net-zero future. To do this, it will be essential to overcome the barrier of the upfront capital investment that industry requires to develop new clean fuel production facilities and increase capacity.
We recognize the unique opportunity clean fuels present for Indigenous businesses and communities and encourage Indigenous participation on all projects. We have designed a distinct process with measures to increase funding of Indigenous-led clean production capacity projects in Canada.
The Clean Fuels Fund provides Indigenous-led projects with cost-shared, conditionally repayable funding. This financial support aims to help build new clean fuel production facilities or retrofit or expand existing ones in Canada.
Additionally, the fund provides non-repayable funding for feasibility studies, basic engineering studies and detailed front-end engineering studies for new facilities, expansions or conversions of existing facilities. These measures will help accelerate the growth and development of the domestic clean fuels industry.
