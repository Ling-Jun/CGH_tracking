Project acceleration
New Westminster Rail Bridge
Early investment to expedite due diligence and early works construction with the goal of shortening the critical paths of high impact projects
Large infrastructure projects take years to plan and develop and are often delayed due to limited availability of development funding. We have committed $500 million to accelerate projects within our priority sectors. In addition, our acceleration investments focuses on projects that are actionable in the short-term and have high probability for future investment, following normal course analysis and decision-making processes.
The acceleration investment is intended to have a measurable impact on the development of projects, such as faster timelines or more comprehensive due diligence. We support projects which create economic growth and have environmental benefits.
Funding for Front-end engineering and design (“FEED”)
The CIB is expanding its Project Acceleration funding to include FEED capital expenditures undertaken by the private sector targeting energy transition projects in Canada, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and clean fuels. The program will help address the funding gap for FEED capital expenditures and accelerate final investment decisions for large energy transition infrastructure projects in Canada.
The program is intended to support infrastructure opportunities with a clear commercial value proposition, long planning and development timelines, low aggregate technology risk and a high likelihood of proceeding to a final investment decision. Minimum program eligibility criteria includes project location within Canada, target sector, funding need and project readiness to enter FEED.
