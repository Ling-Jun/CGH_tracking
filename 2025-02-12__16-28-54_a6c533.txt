Entrepreneurship and Business Development (EBD)
The Entrepreneurship and Business Development (EBD) Program is one of two program contribution streams of the Northern Indigenous Economic Opportunities Program (NIEOP). EBD assists Indigenous entrepreneurs and Indigenous businesses through project-based support for activities that help facilitate the establishment or growth of Indigenous businesses.
CanNor may delegate the delivery of this program to regional Service Delivery Partners (SDPs) in order to increase local and regional access to the program.
The objective of EBD is to:
Increase the number of viable Indigenous businesses and to provide a supportive business environment for Indigenous people in the territories
Promote entrepreneurship in Indigenous communities by improving access to local and regional economic opportunities across various sectors
Enhance access to capital for Indigenous businesses in the territories.
