Net Zero Accelerator InitiativeFrom:Innovation, Science and Economic Development CanadaThe Net Zero Accelerator (NZA) initiative invites forward-looking Canadian companies to contribute to Canada's global leadership efforts by meeting its ambitious target ofreducing GHG emissions by 40 to 45% by 2030, and achieve net zero by 2050.The NZA supports the Government of Canada's strengthened climate plan,A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, to deliver a stronger economy that thrives in a low-carbon world to the benefit of all Canadians. With up to $8 billion in funding to support large-scale investments in key industrial sectors across the country, the NZA ensures that Canada:remains competitive in a net-zero economyreduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsThe NZA has been in high demand since its launch in 2020. The Strategic Innovation Fund is prioritizing projects that can deliver near-term emissions reductions to help meet the 2030 target.Investment pillarsThe following NZA investment pillars have been chosen to maximize the impact of program investments:Decarbonization of large emittersFocusing on near-term emissions reduction —Under this pillar, investments aim to help Canada's largest emitting industrial sectors such as oil and gas and heavy industry (steel, aluminum, cement, mining and mineral processing and chemicals) dramatically reduce their current domestic GHG footprint faster and with less financial risk. This pillar primarily supports Canada's 2030 climate goals, while aligning with 2050 objectives. With the right investments, this pillar could preserve thousands of jobs across Canada for decades to come.Investment principles for the decarbonization of large emittersSupport Canada's 2030 emissions reduction target, while remaining in line with the net-zero by 2050 goalPrioritize developed technologies that can be used by 2030Prioritize projects that will have additional or quicker benefits than would have been achieved without NZA investmentProvide meaningful reductions in domestic GHG emissions, with strong preference given to those with quantifiable and direct GHG reductionsIndustrial transformationHelping established industries transition to the net-zero economy —Under this pillar, investments are aimed at ensuring that established industrial sectors remain successful and competitive in the net-zero global economy of the future. Given the objective of achieving net zero within less than three decades and rapidly increasing global competition in developing clean-growth sectors, Canada's industrial base in key sectors such as automotive transportation, aerospace and electricity (or electrification) needs to shift quickly towards net-zero models.Investment principles for industrial transformationHelp to move sectors away from GHG-intensive activitiesHelp sectors research, develop and adopt new processes and products with low carbon intensity, for Canadian and international marketsPrioritize proposals that are part of a group of coordinated projects and will have sector-wide impactsSupport projects that show significant potential to generate medium- to long-term GHG impactsClean technology and battery ecosystem developmentCapitalizing on net-zero opportunities by fostering emerging sectors —Under this pillar, investments are aimed at capitalizing on emerging clean economy opportunities, establishing Canada as a global clean tech leader and promoting the development of clean technologies such as hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS); and a made-in-Canada battery ecosystem.Investment principles for clean technology and battery ecosystem developmentSupport disruptive technologies that significantly and positively change how a sector works from a GHG emissions perspectivePrioritize investment in emerging clean technologies shown to have market potentialSupport creation of a domestic battery ecosystem and supply chain in CanadaSupport projects that show significant potential to achieve medium- to long-term GHG impactsOur investment decisions under each pillar are guided by these core investment principles:Build a balanced portfolio— Make sensible investments across all of the pillars to advance both 2030 and 2050 climate goalsMaximize leverage— Bring together funding partners from a range of public and private sectors and highlight projects with a higher share of private investmentWork with provinces and territories— Support investments that are aligned with provincial and territorial decarbonization priorities and consider regional environmental, industrial and economic needsOther investment decision considerations include a project's ability to:deliver on intended outcomescreate and maintain high-skill, long-term employment in Canadadevelop supply chains and intellectual property opportunitiespromote Canadian global competitivenessInterested in applying?The NZA is part of the Strategic Innovation Fund, which accepts applications on an ongoing, non-competitive basis.
