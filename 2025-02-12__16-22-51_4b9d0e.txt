Zero-Emission Buses Initiative
Diesel buses are significant greenhouse gas contributors across Canada.
Zero-emission buses (ZEBs) are an alternative to both improve transit and transition to low-carbon infrastructure. This initiative targets the accelerated adoption of over 5,000 zero-emission transit and school buses.
Bus owners can use our financing to accelerate the modernization of their bus fleets. This financing, in the form of direct loans, can cover the higher upfront capital costs of ZEBs.
Loan repayments are sourced from actual savings generated by the lower cost of operating ZEBs compared to the higher cost of operating diesel buses.
City of Calgary
Our partnership with Canada Infrastructure Bank has been critical to transitioning our fleet to zero-emission vehicles much quicker than we could have done on our own. It is important for Calgarians to know that in making the switch from diesel to electric, the savings in operations will actually cover the cost of the loan. When it comes to climate change, we are committed to bold moves that are both economically and environmentally sustainable.
