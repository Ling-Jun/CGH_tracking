Transcription – Talk to your financial institution about growing your small or medium business
Are you a small or medium-sized business owner operating in Canada?
Keeping up with the competition and your customers' demands takes a lot of effort, and above all, money.
But did you know the improved Canada Small Business Financing Program (or CSBFP) can help?
That's right: the CSBFP is here to help you start, support and grow your operations with expanded financing options including a line of credit.
You could use this to finance working capital costs, intellectual property, renovations, equipment and more.
When talking to your financial institution about a line of credit or loan, ask about the CSBFP. There are now additional financing products, new classes of loans, increased loan amounts and terms available for you.
To learn more about the program, visit Canada.ca/csbfp and download the pamphlet.
