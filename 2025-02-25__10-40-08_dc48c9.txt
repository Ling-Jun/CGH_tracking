Scale AI helps companies enhance their AI-based product and service offerings, as well as assists with AI go-to-market strategies to boost revenues.
Our mission is to make the adoption of AI easier across industries, driving productivity and boosting competitiveness.
We reimburse up to 40% of expenses for approved projects that target the adoption or commercialization of AI for value chains
Who we fund
We invest in projects across a range of industries that are deploying AI to enhance their value chain.
We look for innovative, collaborative projects that leverage AI to improve Value Chains. Project participants can be:
Solution Adopters
Product Companies
Service Providers
Academia
Consultants
What we look for
We select projects based on the following criteria:
In-Scope
: Does the project align with SCALE AI’s strategy of boosting industry Productivity by leveraging AI technologies to improve Value Chains?
Collaboration
: Is the project collaborative, with meaningful contributions and benefits for multiple stakeholders in the Value Chain, and including at least 1 SME (<500 FTEs)?
Incremental
: Will incremental AI development will be created in this project (vs existing solutions)? What foreground IP will be created? How is the project different from regular business undertakings?
Readiness
: Have executives endorsed the project?  Has work been done to validate the project’s technical feasibility,  e.g., data assessment, POC? Is there sufficient AI expertise in the consortium to deliver & deploy the solution?

Will Scale AI help me find partners?

Who can apply for funding?

How long does the selection process take?
Scale AI is committed to providing a business-friendly and efficient application process. The length of the selection process depends mainly on project teams’ responsiveness and speed of iteration on feedback provided by the Scale AI investment team. Once a comprehensive, detailed submission is provided, our selection process will take about one month to complete.
Do we have to pay back any funding that our project receives from Scale AI?
No. The money invested by Scale AI is in the form of a grant. You do not need to repay it.
Do I need to become a member before submitting a project?
Non-Scale AI members can submit a project for evaluation, but if your project is selected, you must become a member in order to receive funding. Scale AI members also benefit from guidance from the Scale AI investment and intellectual property team, and can tap into opportunities to work with other Scale AI members as potential clients and service providers.
Who will own the intellectual property (IP) created in my Scale AI project?
The project members have complete flexibility to decide who will own the IP created in their projects. Neither the Government nor Scale AI will own any of the IP.
Will I have to give others permission to access or use the intellectual property (IP) or data generated in my SCALE AI project?
No, you do not have to give anyone outside the project access or permission to use your IP or data. But remember – Scale AI’s mandate is to develop Canada’s AI ecosystem so, in selecting new projects for investment, we assess how you propose that the new IP and data generated in your project can benefit more than just the project participants.
For example, can the results be made generically available for use by other Scale AI members who are not your competitors? Or, is there another way your project will provide concrete benefits to other Scale AI members, such as through sharing lessons learned or other experiences developed in your project?
Intellectual property (IP) is complicated. What if I don’t know how my newly-created project IP could be safely leveraged by others?
We understand that IP is complicated and that you may have lots of questions.  That’s why we have an experienced IP lawyer on staff to help coach you. Our IP lawyer is not a replacement for getting your own solid IP legal advice, but together with our investment directors, Scale AI’s IP lawyer can help you put together a project submission that can protect your IP and still find ways to allow your IP to be safely leveraged by others in the Scale AI ecosystem.
What kinds of intellectual property (IP) might be created in a Scale AI project?
A key piece of IP usually created in Scale AI projects are the trained AI models.   These can be protected as secrets (sometimes called trade secrets, confidential information or proprietary information) or some choose to make them available to others as open-source software (OSS) or by other means of publishing, such as through white papers. It is also possible in some circumstances to file for patent protection of AI-related inventions, such as methods of training models or other methods relating to developing, training, validating or using AI models.
Which is the best way to protect my project’s IP?
The best approach for protecting your project’s IP will depend heavily on (i) your business model (how you make money) and (ii) the nature of the new IP created in the project. Our experienced IP lawyer is available to help you understand the options.
Can I share my project’s IP while still protecting my commercial interests?
A full answer to this question will depend on the details of your IP and your situation, however all types of IP (e.g. trade secrets, confidential/proprietary information, patents, copyrights, etc.) can be licensed to others, whether through open-source licenses or regular commercial licensing. In legal terms, “licensing” just refers to granting permission to someone to use your IP.
The commercial terms that accompany the license (e.g. whether it is open-source, or there are royalties, or a cross-license granted back, time or geography limits, market restrictions, or other costs or restrictions) can be tailored to meet just about any business need.
Will Scale AI expect me to submit any patent applications to protect my new IP?
No. While we will encourage you to use all available IP tools available to protect your IP (because it just makes good business sense to do so!), you remain in control of how you choose to protect your IP.
How do I protect my confidential information and IP while meeting with potential project partners?
You should never discuss or disclose confidential or proprietary information to potential project partners (or others!) without first having a signed non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in place. Second, even once an NDA is in place, use the “need-to-know” principle to guide what you disclose to the other company. Third, it is always a good idea to mark each page of sensitive documents with a “Confidential Information of [Your Company]” marking to make it clear to others that the document must be handled confidentially (this step alone, however, is not usually enough to protect you).
These 3 simple steps, together, will make all the difference to protecting your confidential information.
Do I need an NDA with Scale AI before submitting a project proposal?
Although an NDA should be entered before disclosing your confidential information to anyone, rest assured that Scale AI will protect your submission as confidential even without an NDA. That said, if you would like us to sign an NDA, we will be happy to enter a suitable NDA covering your proposal.
