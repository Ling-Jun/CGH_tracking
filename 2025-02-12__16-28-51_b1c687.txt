About IDEANorth
Inclusive Diversification and Economic Advancement in the NorthÂ (IDEANorth) makes foundational investments in economic infrastructure, sector development and capacity building to help position  Northerners in the territories to take advantage of Canada's innovation economy.
IDEANorth builds on CanNor's previous Strategic Investments in Northern Economic Development (SINED) economic development programming to better align, advance, encourage and support broader economic opportunities, as well as the specific economic and business needs of each territory.
The IDEANorth program focuses on four priority areas: economic growth and sector development; business scale-up, productivity and innovation; small-scale economic infrastructure development; and foundational economic infrastructure.
IDEANorth helps enable Northerners to take advantage of northern economic opportunities to grow a strong, diverse, and sustainable economy in Canada's North. IDEANorth supports community economic growth through  investments in small-scale infrastructure to allow communities and businesses to extend services and by supporting the early stages of large-scale infrastructure projects.
IDEANorth is delivered directly through the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency.
