University of Toronto Retrofits
Meeting Canadaâ€™s emissions goals requires transforming how we build and fuel our homes and industries. Green infrastructure investments support this transition through energy efficient building retrofits and electric and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.
Our Investment and Advisory teams work with a variety of public sector entities and private sector partners to develop the next generation of green infrastructure. We provide accessible debt financing for infrastructure that also creates employment opportunities.
