Income Tax Folio S3-F8-C2, Tax Incentives for Clean Energy EquipmentSeries 3: Property Investments and Savings PlansFolio 8: Resource PropertiesChapter 2: Tax Incentives for Clean Energy EquipmentImportant noticeFederal Budget 2021 introduced a number of measures to promote the manufacture and use of clean energy equipment. The new measures were part ofBill C-19which became law onJune 23, 2022. This Folio will be updated to reflect the new measures.The new tax measures include:Classes 43.1 and 43.2 are expanded to include additional eligible properties such as equipment used to produce solid and liquid fuels from specified waste material or carbon dioxide; a broader range of equipment used for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water; and equipment used to dispense hydrogen for use inhydrogen-poweredautomotive equipment and vehicles. For a full list of eligible properties, refer tosection44ofBill C-19(S.C. 2022, c. 10).In addition, certain eligible properties powered fully or partially by fossil fuels are no longer eligible or have to meet new conditions.The expansion ofClasses 43.1and 43.2applies in respect of property that is acquired and that becomes available for use on or afterApril 19, 2021, where it has not been used or acquired for use before that day. The removal of certain property from eligibility forClasses 43.1and 43.2, as well as the application of the new conditions to equipment which uses fossil fuels, apply in respect of property that becomes available for useafter 2024.For tax years which beginafter 2021, a temporary measure to reduce the federal corporate income tax rates for qualifyingzero-emissiontechnology manufacturersfrom 15%to 7.5%(for income otherwise taxed at the general corporate rate) orfrom 9%to 4.5%(for income otherwise taxed at the small business rate) is adopted.Federal Budget 2022 announced that the Department of Finance Canada will engage with experts to establish an investment tax credit of upto 30%, focused onnet-zerotechnologies, battery storage solutions, and clean hydrogen. In addition, the eligibility underClasses 43.1and 43.2will be expanded to includeair-sourceheat pumps primarily used for space or water heating.SummaryThe Income Tax Act and Income Tax Regulations include the following measures to encourage Canadian taxpayers to make investments in qualifying clean energy generation and energy conservation projects:an accelerated capital cost allowance (CCA) for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment;a first-year enhanced CCA for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment which allows a taxpayer to fully deduct the capital cost of eligible properties in the first year they are available for use by the taxpayer;Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE), which is a category of expenditures relating to the development of eligible clean energy generation and energy conservation projects that may be deducted in full in the year incurred, carried forward indefinitely for use in futuretax yearsor renounced under aflow-throughshare agreement; andAtlantic investment tax creditof 10%of the cost of prescribed energy generation and conservation properties.The purpose of this Chapter is to describe these incentives and the criteria necessary to benefit from them.Responsibility for administering the tax incentives is shared between the CRA and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). According tosubsection 13(18.1), theTechnical Guide toClass 43.1and 43.2, which is published by NRCan, applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters that arise when determining whether a property qualifies for accelerated CCA. The guide provides technical information on eligible properties that meet the requirements of the particular paragraph or subparagraph ofClass 43.1, ineligible properties that are specifically excluded fromClass 43.1, tables of typical capital costs for the different technologies and the relevant forms necessary to obtain a technical opinion from NRCan on the scientific and engineering requirements. This guide is available on the NRCan web page entitledTax Savings for Industry.For the purposes of the definition of CRCE insubsection 66.1(6), theTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)published by NRCan applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters. This guide is also available on the NRCan web page entitled Tax Savings for Industry.The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issues income tax folios to provide a summary of technical interpretations and positions regarding certain provisions contained in income tax law. Due to their technical nature, folios are used primarily by tax specialists and other individuals who have an interest in tax matters. While each paragraph in a chapter of a folio may relate to provisions of the law in force at the time it was written (see theApplicationsection), the information provided is not a substitute for the law. The reader should, therefore, consider the chapter’s information in light of the relevant provisions of the law in force for the particular tax year being considered.The CRA may have published additional guidance and detailed filing instructions on matters discussed in this Chapter and other topics that may be of interest. See the CRA’sForms and publicationsweb page for this and other topics that may be of interest.Table of contentsDiscussion and interpretationAbbreviations and definitions usedAccelerated CCAGeneral rulesProperty eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.2Specified energy property rulesAccelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCAGeneral positionsCanadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)Geothermal energyTest wind turbinesGeneral overview – deductionsFlow-through shares – subsection 66(15)Principal-business corporation defined in subsection 66(15)Flow-through sharesAtlantic investment tax creditTable of eligible propertiesApplicationReferenceHistoryDiscussion and interpretationAbbreviations and definitions used2.1The following abbreviations are used in this Chapter and have the meaning contained in the Act:CCA– capital cost allowance;CCEE– cumulative Canadian exploration expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6);CEE– Canadian exploration expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6);CEE(CRCE)– Canadian renewable and conservation expense included inparagraph (g.1)of the definition of CEE insubsection 66.1(6);CRCE– Canadian renewable and conservation expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6)andsubsection 1219(1)of the Regulations;FTS– flow-through share as defined in subsection 66(15).

For more information refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F8-C1,Principal-businessCorporations in the Resource Industries; andUCC– undepreciated capital cost as defined insubsection 13(21).2.2The termprimarilyis usually considered to be a threshold of more than50%. In establishing whether a particular property is used primarily for the purpose of a given activity, different factors are examined such as the proportion of time that it is used in this activity or the relative proportions of the output that is generated from the property. In addition to this quantitative test, the circumstances may require a qualitative assessment of the taxpayer’s main purpose in using the property.2.3Generally, the phraseall or substantially allmeans at least90%.Accelerated CCA2.4A taxpayer may claim CCA only on property described inSchedule IIof the Regulations that was acquired for the purpose of earning income. For general information relating to CCA, refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowanceand the CRA web pageClaiming capital cost allowance (CCA).2.4.1The Government of Canada's 2018 Fall Economic Statement introduced theAccelerated Investment Incentivewhich creates an enhanced CCA for certain eligible properties (referred to asfirst-yearenhanced CCA). A taxpayer can claim it only for the year in which the eligible property first becomes available for use. Generally, property described inClass 43.1or 43.2which is acquired afterNovember 20, 2018and put into usebefore 2028will meet the definition ofaccelerated investment propertyinsubsection 1104(4)of the Regulations. Such property will be eligible for thefirst-yearenhanced CCA if all other requirements are met.General rules2.5Clean energy generation and energy conservation technologies are a key component of the Government’s approach to promoting sustainable economic growth and can contribute to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. One way to promote these technologies is to allow a business to reduce its taxable income in the early years of an asset’s operation by claiming CCA at a high rate. This accelerated CCA is an exception to the general practice of setting CCA rates based on the useful life of an asset.2.6Class 43.1 and Class 43.2 ofSchedule IIof the Regulations provide accelerated CCA rates for qualifying investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment situated in Canada.Class 43.1is the permanent class and hasa 30%CCA rate on a declining balance basis. This Class includes a detailed description of the different types of eligible properties.2.7Class 43.2 has a 50% CCA rate on a declining balance basis. Most of the equipment that is described inClass 43.1will qualify forthe 50%CCA rate underClass 43.2when the property is acquiredbefore 2025. However, the following equipment only qualifies forthe 30%CCA rate inClass 43.1:mid-efficiency, fully or partiallyfossil-fuelledcogeneration systems;electric vehicle charging stations set up to supply more than10 kWbut less than90 kWof continuous power; andelectrical energy storage equipment connected to one of the above systems andstand-aloneelectrical energy storage systems meeting particular efficiency requirements.2.8Where a depreciable property qualifies for Class 43.1or 43.2, it cannot be included in another class even though the property may otherwise meet the requirements of that other class.2.9Class 43.1 deals with the following two broad categories of equipment as listed in theTable of eligible properties:equipment described in paragraphs (a)to (c)ofClass 43.1; andequipment described in any of the subparagraphs ofparagraph (d)ofClass 43.1.2.10Eligible input sources for equipment included in Class 43.1or 43.2are:renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal, wave or tidal energy;eligible waste fuels defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations such as biogas,bio-oil, digester gas, landfill gas, municipal waste, plant residue, pulp and paper waste, and wood waste or producer gas and in some cases spent pulping liquor; andfossil fuels (other than solution gas) where the designated heat rate is satisfied and in certain other situations described insubparagraph (d)(ix)ofClass 43.1.Property eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.22.11The depreciable property must:be situated in Canada;be acquired by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada or from property situated in Canada, or the property must be acquired by a taxpayer in order to be leased to a lessee who will use the property for the same income earning purpose; andsubject to certain exceptions, not have been used for any purpose before the taxpayer acquired the property.2.12Reconditioned and remanufactured equipment is excluded fromClass 43.1or 43.2even if the reconditioning makes the equipment more energy efficient by current standards.2.13Used equipment that is depreciable property may generally be included inClass 43.1or 43.2, if it:was included in Class 43.1 or 43.2, respectively, by the vendor;remains at the same location at which it was used by the vendor; andhas been acquired by the taxpayer not more than five years from the time it became available for use to the vendor as determined pursuant tosubsections 13(26)to (31).2.14The testing and commissioning of otherwise new equipment prior to the purchaser taking possession will not normally result in a finding that the property was used prior to its acquisition. However, a property will be considered to have been used where the vendor has used it regularly for demonstration purposes.2.15An eligible property must satisfy all the conditions for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2on an annual basis. There is a limited exception insubsection 1104(14)of the Regulations for a property that is part of an eligible system that was previously operated in a qualifying manner. Such property is considered to be operated in the required manner during a period of deficiency, failure or shutdown of the system that is beyond the taxpayer’s control if the taxpayer makes all reasonable efforts to rectify the problem within a reasonable time. Undersubsection 1104(15), this exception also applies where another person or partnership owns property that provides a steam host which is necessary for the taxpayer’s system to operate in the manner required byClass 43.1or 43.2.2.16If the exception does not apply and the property no longer qualifies forClass 43.1or 43.2, pursuant tosubsection 13(5), the UCC of the property will be transferred fromClass 43.1or 43.2to the other class in which it is described as of the beginning of the particulartax year. Similarly, if in a following year, the property satisfies the annual requirements for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2, the property will be reclassified intoClass 43.1or 43.2as of the beginning of thetax year. For more information, refer to¶1.123to 1.131ofIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1,General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.2.17Properties described insubparagraphs (c)(i), (d)(vii),(d)(viii),(d)(ix),(d)(xi),(d)(xiii),(d)(xiv),(d)(xvi)andsubparagraph (d)(xvii)ofClass 43.1andparagraph (a)ofClass 43.2may be included inClass 43.1or 43.2only if they are in compliance with environmental laws,by-lawsand regulations at the time the property first becomes available for use.Specified energy property rules2.18In general, the specified energy property rules limit the amount of CCA that passive investors may deduct to the amount of income from such property.2.19Specified energy property within the meaning ofsubsection 1100(25)of the Regulations generally means property included inClass 43.1or 43.2. However, the definition excludes properties used primarily for certain income earning purposes, in particular:a property acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada (other than the business of selling the energy generated from the property),a property that is acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from another property situated in Canada; ora property that is leased by (i) a corporation whose principal business is the renting or leasing of properties described in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iii) of the Regulations or (ii) a partnership that meets the conditions in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iv) and that is leased to:a person who can reasonably be expected to use the property primarily for the purpose of earning income from business or property as described in ¶2.19(a) or (b); ora corporation or partnership that meets the principal business test described in ¶2.21 or a partnership that meets the conditions in paragraph 1100(26)(b).2.20According to subsection 1100(24), if a property is a specified energy property, CCA cannot be deducted to the extent that it would create or increase a loss from all such properties owned by the taxpayer. Essentially, the amount of CCA that may be claimed on a specified energy property is limited to the income earned from specified energy property and certain other similar energy conservation properties and thus, the CCA deduction cannot be used to shelter the taxpayer’s other sources of income.2.21The specified energy property rules do not apply to corporations (or a partnership that meets the prescribed conditions inparagraph 1100(26)(b))whose principal business (theprincipal business test) throughout the year is:manufacturing or processing;mining operations; orthe sale, distribution or production of electricity, natural gas, oil, steam, heat or any other form of energy or potential energy.Example 1The following illustrates how the specified energy property rules will apply in certain situations:A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a wind turbine that generates electricity that is consumed in its business. The wind turbine meets the requirements ofsubparagraph (d)(v)ofClass 43.1. The amount of electricity consumed in the taxpayer’s income earning activities exceeds50%of the electricity generated by the wind turbine. Here, because the wind turbine is used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada theClass 43.2property is not a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires aClass 43.2property that generates electricity which is partly used in its business. The amount of electricity consumed in carrying on the taxpayer’s income earning activities is25%of the electricity generated by theClass 43.2property. Because theClass 43.2property is not used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada it is a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are limited in accordance with the specified energy property rules.A corporation whose principal business throughout the year is manufacturing acquires solar photovoltaic equipment. The corporation enters into an agreement with the provincial power authority to sell all of the electricity generated from the equipment. The equipment meets the requirements ofsubparagraph (d)(vi)ofClass 43.1. Because the taxpayer meets the principal business test described in¶2.21, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.Example 2This example illustrates the application of the specified energy property rules to a homeowner who owns a solar panel and sells the electricity generated from it to the provincial power authority. Since the taxpayer does not use the solar panel for the income earning purpose described in¶2.19, the solar panel is a specified energy property.Application of the specified energy property rulesDescriptionUCC pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s UCC opening balance for the tax year$75n/aTaxpayer’s income for the tax year (excluding the income from the solar panels included inClass 43.2)n/a$100Net income from solar panels included in Class 43.2n/a$30Taxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$130Deduction of limited CCA because of the application of the specified energy property rules($30)($30)Taxpayer’s UCC balance and income for the tax year after claiming limited CCA$45$100Accelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCA2.21.1Under the first-year enhanced CCA, a taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct the capital cost of eligibleClass 43.1or 43.2property in the first year the property becomes available for use by the taxpayer. This measure applies to property acquired afterNovember 20, 2018. As reflected in the table below, it will be gradually phased out startingin 2024and will no longer be in effect for properties that become available for useafter 2027.For general information relating to measures adopted as part ofthe 2018Fall Economic Statement, refer to the web pageAccelerated Investment Incentive.

For more information relating to CCA, refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1,General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance, as well as the web pagesClaiming capital cost allowance (CCA)and theAccelerated Investment Incentive.2.21.3The availability of the first-year enhanced CCA does not override the application of the specified energy property rules describedin ¶2.18to 2.21. A property might be an accelerated investment property described inClass 43.1or 43.2and also be a specified energy property within the meaning ofsubsection 1100(25)of the Regulations. In such a case, the CCA deduction for the tax year will be limited as describedin ¶2.20and inExamples 1and 2.General positionsPurpose test2.22As a general rule most properties described inClass 43.1must be used by the taxpayer, or the lessee of the taxpayer, primarily for the particular purpose of generating, collecting, storing or conserving energy, including the production ofbio-oil, biogas and producer gas (thePurpose Test).2.23However, for certain properties, the Purpose Test can be met by someone other than the owner or the lessee of the equipment. For example:A taxpayer owns heat recovery equipment that extracts thermal waste generated directly in an industrial process, other than a process that generates electricity. The taxpayer enters into a contract with an arm’s length customer for the sale of the thermal waste and as a result the customer does not have to acquire energy. The Purpose Test described insubparagraph (d)(iv)ofClass 43.1will be met.A taxpayer owns equipment and uses it in a system that converts wood waste or plant residue intobio-oil. Thebio-oilis then sold to an arm’s length customer who uses it primarily for the purpose of generating heat used directly in an industrial process. The Purpose Test described insubparagraph (d)(xi)ofClass 43.1will be met.2.24The termindustrial processas used inparagraph (d)ofClass 43.1generally means an operation in which goods are manufactured or processed.Eligible and ineligible properties for Classes 43.1 and 43.22.25Detailed information on eligible and ineligible properties is available in the Technical Guide toClass 43.1and 43.2on the NRCan web page entitledTax Savings for Industry.2.26Generally, a building or part of a building is specifically excluded from the description of eligible property inClass 43.1. However, there are some exceptions, for example:a solar collector that is not a window and that is integrated into a building is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(i)ofClass 43.1;an electrical generating plant, including a powerhouse, is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(ii)ofClass 43.1;a solar cell or module that is integrated into a building is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(vi)ofClass 43.1.2.27Transmission equipment is usually specifically excluded from the description of eligible property inClass 43.1. However, transmission equipment is eligible for inclusion for properties described in the following subparagraphs ofClass 43.1:(d)(ii)small-scalehydro-electricinstallation,(d)(v)wind energy conversion system,(d)(vi) fixedlocation photovoltaic equipment, (d)(vii) equipment for generating electrical energy, heat energy or both, solely from geothermal energy, and(d)(xiv)property usingwater-current, tidal or wave energy.2.28The determination of whether equipment is electrical generating equipment or transmission equipment, which is defined insubsection 1104(13)of the Regulations, is generally based on whether the electricity is ready to be put on transmission lines. A generating system typically ends at the point where the electricity is ready for use.Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)2.29CRCE includes certain intangible expenditures incurred in respect of the development of a project for which it is reasonable to expect that at least50%of the capital cost of depreciable property to be used in the project would qualify for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2.2.30In order to qualify as CRCE, the expenditures must:be payable to a person or partnership with whom the taxpayer is dealing at arm's length; andnot be specifically excluded from CRCE undersubsection 1219(2)of the Regulations.2.31The termprojectis interpreted to include activities carried out to identify the objectives of the project, designing the process for achieving such objectives and completing the planned undertaking.2.32Examples of the types of expenditures that qualify as CRCE include the cost of certainpre-feasibilityand feasibility studies, environmental assessment expenditures, the cost ofsocio-economicstudies, and expenditures for negotiating power purchase agreements. For more information on the type of expenditures that qualify as CRCE, refer to the NRCanTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).2.33Expenditures on a project that is subsequently abandoned may still qualify as CRCE if at the time the expenditures were incurred, it was reasonable to expect that at least50%of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the proposed project would qualify for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2.2.34Office expenses, management expenses, accounting expenses, marketing expenses and most business travelling expenses do not qualify as CRCE because they are incurred in respect of the management or administration of the business.2.35Different types of security payments made in relation to a qualifying project (for example, payments to guarantee the completion and performance of the project or for network upgrades) required by some provincial authorities do not qualify as CRCE. Also, any costs incurred with respect to the posting of the guarantee represent financing costs, which do not qualify as CRCE.2.36Expenditures to acquire an intellectual property or to develop a patent are generally included in the capital cost of depreciable property described inClass 14. However, ifClass 14does not apply, the expenditures may qualify for inclusion inClass 14.1.2.37Expenditures incurred to develop new technologies for renewable energy equipment do not qualify as CRCE. These activities may benefit from the incentives relating to scientific research and experimental development. For more information, refer to the CRA web pageScientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentive Program.Geothermal energy2.37.1In addition to the general rules describedin ¶2.29to 2.37, for a project for which it is reasonable to expect that atleast 50%of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the project would be the capital cost of any property that is described insubparagraph (d)(vii)ofClass 43.1(which is equipment used primarily to generate electrical energy, heat energy, or both, solely from geothermal energy), the following expenses may also qualify as CRCE, provided that they are incurred afterMarch 21, 2017:the cost of drilling geothermal wells; andexpenses incurred solely to determine the extent and quality of a geothermal resource, such as for example, the cost of completing an exploratory well.2.37.2However, the cost of completing either (i) a production well or (ii) an exploratory well that is used for production (including small-scale heat or electricity production) will not qualify as CRCE but may form part of the cost of depreciable property and may be eligible for an inclusion in Class 43.2 of the Regulations.2.37.3CRCE treatment will be available for expenses in geothermal projects only if, in the year incurred, such expenses meet the requirements of all applicable environmental laws, by-laws and regulations.Test wind turbines2.38Usually, expenditures incurred for the acquisition and installation of depreciable property do not qualify as CRCE. However, expenditures for a test wind turbine that is part of a wind farm project and that meets the requirements set out insubsection 1219(3)of the Regulations will qualify as CRCE.2.39In order for a wind turbine to qualify as a test wind turbine, the taxpayer must obtain a joint determination from the CRA and NRCan with respect to the legislative requirements insubsection 1219(3)of the Regulations. For more information, refer to the NRCanTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).2.40Generally, a test wind turbine must:otherwise meet the requirements of a wind energy conversion system undersubparagraph (d)(v)ofClass 43.1;be installed at the site of a planned wind farm project;meet certain spacing and capacity requirements; andtest the level of electrical energy production from wind prior to the construction of the wind farm project.2.41There can be more than one test wind turbine for each wind farm project.General overview – deductions2.42Expenditures incurred by a taxpayer that qualify as CRCE are CEE and are reported on theForm T2Sch12. These expenditures are added to the taxpayer’s CCEE pool and may be deducted by the taxpayer in thetax yearthat they are incurred or carried forward indefinitely for deduction in futuretax years.Example 3Application of the annual CEE deduction to compute a taxpayer’s income for atax yearDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Feasibility study expenses that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$70n/aMaximum CEE deduction for the tax year($70)($70)Taxpayer’s CCEE balance and income for the tax year$0$302.43Any consideration received by a taxpayer for property or services, the cost of which was CRCE, will be deducted from the taxpayer’s CCEE pool undersubsection 66(12.1). For example, if the taxpayer has disposed of feasibility studies, the cost of which previously qualified asCEE(CRCE), the taxpayer will reduce its CCEE pool by the amount of the consideration received.Example 4Application of the annual CEE deduction to compute a taxpayer’s income for a year in the case of recovery of CEEDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Feasibility study expenditures that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$70n/aDisposition of feasibility study to an arm’s length purchaser for $30($30)n/aMaximum CEE deduction for the tax year($40)($40)Taxpayer’s CCEE balance and income for the tax year$0$60Partnerships2.44A partnership cannot deduct CRCE. Instead, the partner’s CEE(CRCE) will include its share of the partnership’s CEE (CRCE), if the taxpayer is a member of the partnership at the end of the partnership’s fiscal period. For more information on partnerships, refer toIncome Tax Folio S4-F16-C1, What is a Partnership?2.45A taxpayer who disposes of all of its interest in a partnership during the partnership fiscal period does not share in the partnership’sCEE(CRCE)for that fiscal period. Similarly, any portion ofCEE(CRCE)of the partnership that has been included in a partner’sCEE(CRCE)cannot be transferred to a third party who acquires the partnership interest.2.46The partner adds its share of the partnership’sCEE(CRCE)to its own CCEE pool.  Underclause 53(2)(c)(ii)(C), the adjusted cost base of the partner’s partnership interest is reduced to reflect the partner’s share of the partnership’sCEE(CRCE).Acquisition of control2.47Where a corporation is subject to an acquisition of control, the CCEE pool that exists immediately before the acquisition of control becomes subject to the successor rules insection 66.7(successored CCEE). After the acquisition of control, the successor corporation may deduct the successored CCEE only to the extent of production income from a Canadian resource property as defined insubsection 66(15)that is owned by the corporation immediately before the acquisition of control. For more information on Canadian resource properties refer toInterpretation Bulletin IT-125R4 (Archived) – Dispositions of Resource Propertiesand¶1.21ofIncome Tax Folio S3-F8-C1.2.48A taxpayer who is a PBC operating in clean energy generation and energy conservation industries may have CCEE but will likely not own Canadian resource property. Therefore, after the acquisition of control, successored CCEE will become unusable. To address this issue, the taxpayer is entitled to claim the maximum available CEE in thetax yearthat ends immediately before the acquisition of control according tosubsection 66.1(3). This may create anon-capitalloss that could be deducted in futuretax yearssubject to certain restrictions. For more information concerning the loss restriction rules, refer toInterpretation Bulletin IT-232R3, Losses - Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years.Example 5Creation of anon-capitalloss prior to the acquisition of control where a taxpayer is a PBC operating in clean energy generation and energy conservation industries and it does not own a Canadian resource propertyDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer's CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer's income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Expenses incurred that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$150n/aMaximum CCEE deduction($150)($150)Taxpayer's CCEE balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer's non-capital loss for a tax year subject to the loss restriction rulesn/a($50)Flow-through shares – subsection 66(15)2.49FTSs help corporations that are PBCs which operate in the clean energy generation and energy conservation industries to finance their development activities. A PBC may renounce expenditures that qualify as CRCE to its investors who subscribe for FTSs.
