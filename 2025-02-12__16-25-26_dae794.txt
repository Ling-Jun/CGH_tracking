Income Tax Folio S3-F8-C2, Tax Incentives for Clean Energy Equipment
Series 3: Property Investments and Savings Plans
Folio 8: Resource Properties
Chapter 2: Tax Incentives for Clean Energy Equipment
Important notice
Federal Budget 2021 introduced a number of measures to promote the manufacture and use of clean energy equipment. The new measures were part of
Bill C-19
which became law on
June 23, 2022
. This Folio will be updated to reflect the new measures.
The new tax measures include:
Classes 43.1 and 43.2 are expanded to include additional eligible properties such as equipment used to produce solid and liquid fuels from specified waste material or carbon dioxide; a broader range of equipment used for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water; and equipment used to dispense hydrogen for use in
hydrogen-powered
automotive equipment and vehicles. For a full list of eligible properties, refer to
section
44
of
Bill C-19
(S.C. 2022, c. 10).
In addition, certain eligible properties powered fully or partially by fossil fuels are no longer eligible or have to meet new conditions.
The expansion of
Classes 43.1
and 43.2
applies in respect of property that is acquired and that becomes available for use on or after
April 19, 2021
, where it has not been used or acquired for use before that day. The removal of certain property from eligibility for
Classes 43.1
and 43.2
, as well as the application of the new conditions to equipment which uses fossil fuels, apply in respect of property that becomes available for use
after 2024
.
For tax years which begin
after 2021
, a temporary measure to reduce the federal corporate income tax rates for qualifying
zero-emission
technology manufacturers
from 15%
to 7.5%
(for income otherwise taxed at the general corporate rate) or
from 9%
to 4.5%
(for income otherwise taxed at the small business rate) is adopted.
Federal Budget 2022 announced that the Department of Finance Canada will engage with experts to establish an investment tax credit of up
to 30%
, focused on
net-zero
technologies, battery storage solutions, and clean hydrogen. In addition, the eligibility under
Classes 43.1
and 43.2
will be expanded to include
air-source
heat pumps primarily used for space or water heating.
Summary
The Income Tax Act and Income Tax Regulations include the following measures to encourage Canadian taxpayers to make investments in qualifying clean energy generation and energy conservation projects:
an accelerated capital cost allowance (
CCA
) for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment;
a first-year enhanced CCA for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment which allows a taxpayer to fully deduct the capital cost of eligible properties in the first year they are available for use by the taxpayer;
Canadian renewable and conservation expense (
CRCE
), which is a category of expenditures relating to the development of eligible clean energy generation and energy conservation projects that may be deducted in full in the year incurred, carried forward indefinitely for use in future
tax years
or renounced under a
flow-through
share agreement; and
Atlantic investment tax credit
of 10%
of the cost of prescribed energy generation and conservation properties.
The purpose of this Chapter is to describe these incentives and the criteria necessary to benefit from them.
Responsibility for administering the tax incentives is shared between the CRA and Natural Resources Canada (
NRCan
). According to
subsection 13(18.1)
, the
Technical Guide to
Class 43.1
and 43.2
, which is published by NRCan, applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters that arise when determining whether a property qualifies for accelerated CCA. The guide provides technical information on eligible properties that meet the requirements of the particular paragraph or subparagraph of
Class 43.1
, ineligible properties that are specifically excluded from
Class 43.1
, tables of typical capital costs for the different technologies and the relevant forms necessary to obtain a technical opinion from NRCan on the scientific and engineering requirements. This guide is available on the NRCan web page entitled
Tax Savings for Industry
.
For the purposes of the definition of CRCE in
subsection 66.1(6)
, the
Technical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)
published by NRCan applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters. This guide is also available on the NRCan web page entitled Tax Savings for Industry.
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issues income tax folios to provide a summary of technical interpretations and positions regarding certain provisions contained in income tax law. Due to their technical nature, folios are used primarily by tax specialists and other individuals who have an interest in tax matters. While each paragraph in a chapter of a folio may relate to provisions of the law in force at the time it was written (see the
Application
section), the information provided is not a substitute for the law. The reader should, therefore, consider the chapter’s information in light of the relevant provisions of the law in force for the particular tax year being considered.
The CRA may have published additional guidance and detailed filing instructions on matters discussed in this Chapter and other topics that may be of interest. See the CRA’s
Forms and publications
web page for this and other topics that may be of interest.

2.2
The term
primarily
is usually considered to be a threshold of more than
50%
. In establishing whether a particular property is used primarily for the purpose of a given activity, different factors are examined such as the proportion of time that it is used in this activity or the relative proportions of the output that is generated from the property. In addition to this quantitative test, the circumstances may require a qualitative assessment of the taxpayer’s main purpose in using the property.
2.3
Generally, the phrase
all or substantially all
means at least
90%
.
Accelerated CCA
2.4
A taxpayer may claim CCA only on property described in
Schedule II
of the Regulations that was acquired for the purpose of earning income. For general information relating to CCA, refer to
Income Tax
Folio S3-F4-C1
, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance
and the CRA web page
Claiming capital cost allowance (CCA)
.
2.4.1
The Government of Canada's 2018 Fall Economic Statement introduced the
Accelerated Investment Incentive
which creates an enhanced CCA for certain eligible properties (referred to as
first-year
enhanced CCA
). A taxpayer can claim it only for the year in which the eligible property first becomes available for use. Generally, property described in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
which is acquired after
November 20, 2018
and put into use
before 2028
will meet the definition of
accelerated investment property
in
subsection 1104(4)
of the Regulations. Such property will be eligible for the
first-year
enhanced CCA if all other requirements are met.
General rules
2.5
Clean energy generation and energy conservation technologies are a key component of the Government’s approach to promoting sustainable economic growth and can contribute to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. One way to promote these technologies is to allow a business to reduce its taxable income in the early years of an asset’s operation by claiming CCA at a high rate. This accelerated CCA is an exception to the general practice of setting CCA rates based on the useful life of an asset.
2.6
Class 43.1 and Class 43.2 of
Schedule II
of the Regulations provide accelerated CCA rates for qualifying investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment situated in Canada.
Class 43.1
is the permanent class and has
a 30%
CCA rate on a declining balance basis. This Class includes a detailed description of the different types of eligible properties.
2.7
Class 43.2 has a 50% CCA rate on a declining balance basis. Most of the equipment that is described in
Class 43.1
will qualify for
the 50%
CCA rate under
Class 43.2
when the property is acquired
before 2025
. However, the following equipment only qualifies for
the 30%
CCA rate in
Class 43.1
:
mid-efficiency, fully or partially
fossil-fuelled
cogeneration systems;
electric vehicle charging stations set up to supply more than
10 kW
but less than
90 kW
of continuous power; and
electrical energy storage equipment connected to one of the above systems and
stand-alone
electrical energy storage systems meeting particular efficiency requirements.
2.8
Where a depreciable property qualifies for Class 43.1
or 43.2
, it cannot be included in another class even though the property may otherwise meet the requirements of that other class.
2.9
Class 43.1 deals with the following two broad categories of equipment as listed in the
Table of eligible properties
:
equipment described in paragraphs (a)
to (c)
of
Class 43.1
; and
equipment described in any of the subparagraphs of
paragraph (d)
of
Class 43.1
.
2.10
Eligible input sources for equipment included in Class 43.1
or 43.2
are:
renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal, wave or tidal energy;
eligible waste fuels defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations such as biogas,
bio-oil
, digester gas, landfill gas, municipal waste, plant residue, pulp and paper waste, and wood waste or producer gas and in some cases spent pulping liquor; and
fossil fuels (other than solution gas) where the designated heat rate is satisfied and in certain other situations described in
subparagraph (d)(ix)
of
Class 43.1
.
Property eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.2
2.11
The depreciable property must:
be situated in Canada;
be acquired by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada or from property situated in Canada, or the property must be acquired by a taxpayer in order to be leased to a lessee who will use the property for the same income earning purpose; and
subject to certain exceptions, not have been used for any purpose before the taxpayer acquired the property.
2.12
Reconditioned and remanufactured equipment is excluded from
Class 43.1
or 43.2
even if the reconditioning makes the equipment more energy efficient by current standards.
2.13
Used equipment that is depreciable property may generally be included in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
, if it:
was included in Class 43.1 or 43.2, respectively, by the vendor;
remains at the same location at which it was used by the vendor; and
has been acquired by the taxpayer not more than five years from the time it became available for use to the vendor as determined pursuant to
subsections 13(26)
to (31)
.
2.14
The testing and commissioning of otherwise new equipment prior to the purchaser taking possession will not normally result in a finding that the property was used prior to its acquisition. However, a property will be considered to have been used where the vendor has used it regularly for demonstration purposes.
2.15
An eligible property must satisfy all the conditions for inclusion in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
on an annual basis. There is a limited exception in
subsection 1104(14)
of the Regulations for a property that is part of an eligible system that was previously operated in a qualifying manner. Such property is considered to be operated in the required manner during a period of deficiency, failure or shutdown of the system that is beyond the taxpayer’s control if the taxpayer makes all reasonable efforts to rectify the problem within a reasonable time. Under
subsection 1104(15)
, this exception also applies where another person or partnership owns property that provides a steam host which is necessary for the taxpayer’s system to operate in the manner required by
Class 43.1
or 43.2
.
2.16
If the exception does not apply and the property no longer qualifies for
Class 43.1
or 43.2
, pursuant to
subsection 13(5)
, the UCC of the property will be transferred from
Class 43.1
or 43.2
to the other class in which it is described as of the beginning of the particular
tax year
. Similarly, if in a following year, the property satisfies the annual requirements for inclusion in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
, the property will be reclassified into
Class 43.1
or 43.2
as of the beginning of the
tax year
. For more information, refer to

,
(d)(ix)
,
(d)(xi)
,
(d)(xiii)
,
(d)(xiv)

of
Class 43.1
and
paragraph (a)
of
Class 43.2
may be included in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
only if they are in compliance with environmental laws,
by-laws
and regulations at the time the property first becomes available for use.
Specified energy property rules
2.18
In general, the specified energy property rules limit the amount of CCA that passive investors may deduct to the amount of income from such property.
2.19
Specified energy property within the meaning of
subsection 1100(25)
of the Regulations generally means property included in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
. However, the definition excludes properties used primarily for certain income earning purposes, in particular:
a property acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada (other than the business of selling the energy generated from the property),
a property that is acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from another property situated in Canada; or
a property that is leased by (i) a corporation whose principal business is the renting or leasing of properties described in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iii) of the Regulations or (ii) a partnership that meets the conditions in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iv) and that is leased to:
a person who can reasonably be expected to use the property primarily for the purpose of earning income from business or property as described in ¶2.19(a) or (b); or
a corporation or partnership that meets the principal business test described in ¶2.21 or a partnership that meets the conditions in paragraph 1100(26)(b).
2.20
According to subsection 1100(24), if a property is a specified energy property, CCA cannot be deducted to the extent that it would create or increase a loss from all such properties owned by the taxpayer. Essentially, the amount of CCA that may be claimed on a specified energy property is limited to the income earned from specified energy property and certain other similar energy conservation properties and thus, the CCA deduction cannot be used to shelter the taxpayer’s other sources of income.
2.21
The specified energy property rules do not apply to corporations (or a partnership that meets the prescribed conditions in
paragraph 1100(26)(b))
whose principal business (the
principal business test
) throughout the year is:
manufacturing or processing;
mining operations; or
the sale, distribution or production of electricity, natural gas, oil, steam, heat or any other form of energy or potential energy.
Example 1
The following illustrates how the specified energy property rules will apply in certain situations:
A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a wind turbine that generates electricity that is consumed in its business. The wind turbine meets the requirements of
subparagraph (d)(v)
of
Class 43.1
. The amount of electricity consumed in the taxpayer’s income earning activities exceeds
50%
of the electricity generated by the wind turbine. Here, because the wind turbine is used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada the
Class 43.2
property is not a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.
A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a
Class 43.2
property that generates electricity which is partly used in its business. The amount of electricity consumed in carrying on the taxpayer’s income earning activities is
25%
of the electricity generated by the
Class 43.2
property. Because the
Class 43.2
property is not used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada it is a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are limited in accordance with the specified energy property rules.
A corporation whose principal business throughout the year is manufacturing acquires solar photovoltaic equipment. The corporation enters into an agreement with the provincial power authority to sell all of the electricity generated from the equipment. The equipment meets the requirements of
subparagraph (d)(vi)
of
Class 43.1
. Because the taxpayer meets the principal business test described in
¶2.21
, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.
Example 2
This example illustrates the application of the specified energy property rules to a homeowner who owns a solar panel and sells the electricity generated from it to the provincial power authority. Since the taxpayer does not use the solar panel for the income earning purpose described in
¶
2.19
, the solar panel is a specified energy property.

Accelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCA
2.21.1
Under the first-year enhanced CCA, a taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct the capital cost of eligible
Class 43.1
or 43.2
property in the first year the property becomes available for use by the taxpayer. This measure applies to property acquired after
November 20, 2018
. As reflected in the table below, it will be gradually phased out starting
in 2024
and will no longer be in effect for properties that become available for use
after 2027.

For property which is an accelerated investment property, after the year of acquisition, the general CCA calculations are applicable. For more information relating to CCA, refer to
Income Tax
Folio S3-F4-C1,
General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance
, as well as the web pages
Claiming capital cost allowance (CCA)
and the
Accelerated Investment Incentive
.
2.21.3
The availability of the first-year enhanced CCA does not override the application of the specified energy property rules described
in ¶2.18
to 2.21
. A property might be an accelerated investment property described in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
and also be a specified energy property within the meaning of
subsection 1100(25)
of the Regulations. In such a case, the CCA deduction for the tax year will be limited as described
in ¶2.20
and in
Examples 1
and 2
.
General positions
Purpose test
2.22
As a general rule most properties described in
Class 43.1
must be used by the taxpayer, or the lessee of the taxpayer, primarily for the particular purpose of generating, collecting, storing or conserving energy, including the production of
bio-oil
, biogas and producer gas (the
Purpose Test
).
2.23
However, for certain properties, the Purpose Test can be met by someone other than the owner or the lessee of the equipment. For example:
A taxpayer owns heat recovery equipment that extracts thermal waste generated directly in an industrial process, other than a process that generates electricity. The taxpayer enters into a contract with an arm’s length customer for the sale of the thermal waste and as a result the customer does not have to acquire energy. The Purpose Test described in
subparagraph (d)(iv)
of
Class 43.1
will be met.
A taxpayer owns equipment and uses it in a system that converts wood waste or plant residue into
bio-oil
. The
bio-oil
is then sold to an arm’s length customer who uses it primarily for the purpose of generating heat used directly in an industrial process. The Purpose Test described in
subparagraph (d)(xi)
of
Class 43.1
will be met.
2.24
The term
industrial process
as used in
paragraph (d)
of
Class 43.1
generally means an operation in which goods are manufactured or processed.
Eligible and ineligible properties for Classes 43.1 and 43.2
2.25
Detailed information on eligible and ineligible properties is available in the Technical Guide to
Class 43.1
and 43.2
on the NRCan web page entitled
Tax Savings for Industry
.
2.26
Generally, a building or part of a building is specifically excluded from the description of eligible property in
Class 43.1
. However, there are some exceptions, for example:
a solar collector that is not a window and that is integrated into a building is eligible property under
subparagraph (d)(i)
of
Class 43.1
;
an electrical generating plant, including a powerhouse, is eligible property under
subparagraph (d)(ii)
of
Class 43.1
;
a solar cell or module that is integrated into a building is eligible property under
subparagraph (d)(vi)
of
Class 43.1
.
2.27
Transmission equipment is usually specifically excluded from the description of eligible property in
Class 43.1
. However, transmission equipment is eligible for inclusion for properties described in the following subparagraphs of
Class 43.1
:
(d)(ii)
small-scale
hydro-electric
installation,
(d)(v)
wind energy conversion system,
(d)(vi) fixed
location photovoltaic equipment, (d)(vii) equipment for generating electrical energy, heat energy or both, solely from geothermal energy, and
(d)(xiv)
property using
water-current
, tidal or wave energy.
2.28
The determination of whether equipment is electrical generating equipment or transmission equipment, which is defined in
subsection 1104(13)
of the Regulations, is generally based on whether the electricity is ready to be put on transmission lines. A generating system typically ends at the point where the electricity is ready for use.
Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)
2.29
CRCE includes certain intangible expenditures incurred in respect of the development of a project for which it is reasonable to expect that at least
50%
of the capital cost of depreciable property to be used in the project would qualify for inclusion in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
.
2.30
In order to qualify as CRCE, the expenditures must:
be payable to a person or partnership with whom the taxpayer is dealing at arm's length; and
not be specifically excluded from CRCE under
subsection 1219(2)
of the Regulations.
2.31
The term
project
is interpreted to include activities carried out to identify the objectives of the project, designing the process for achieving such objectives and completing the planned undertaking.
2.32
Examples of the types of expenditures that qualify as CRCE include the cost of certain
pre-feasibility
and feasibility studies, environmental assessment expenditures, the cost of
socio-economic
studies, and expenditures for negotiating power purchase agreements. For more information on the type of expenditures that qualify as CRCE, refer to the NRCan
Technical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)
.
2.33
Expenditures on a project that is subsequently abandoned may still qualify as CRCE if at the time the expenditures were incurred, it was reasonable to expect that at least
50%
of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the proposed project would qualify for inclusion in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
.
2.34
Office expenses, management expenses, accounting expenses, marketing expenses and most business travelling expenses do not qualify as CRCE because they are incurred in respect of the management or administration of the business.
2.35
Different types of security payments made in relation to a qualifying project (for example, payments to guarantee the completion and performance of the project or for network upgrades) required by some provincial authorities do not qualify as CRCE. Also, any costs incurred with respect to the posting of the guarantee represent financing costs, which do not qualify as CRCE.
2.36
Expenditures to acquire an intellectual property or to develop a patent are generally included in the capital cost of depreciable property described in
Class 14
. However, if
Class 14
does not apply, the expenditures may qualify for inclusion in
Class 14.1
.
2.37
Expenditures incurred to develop new technologies for renewable energy equipment do not qualify as CRCE. These activities may benefit from the incentives relating to scientific research and experimental development. For more information, refer to the CRA web page
Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentive Program
.
Geothermal energy
2.37.1
In addition to the general rules described
in ¶2.29
to 2.37
, for a project for which it is reasonable to expect that at
least 50%
of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the project would be the capital cost of any property that is described in
subparagraph (d)(vii)
of
Class 43.1
(which is equipment used primarily to generate electrical energy, heat energy, or both, solely from geothermal energy), the following expenses may also qualify as CRCE, provided that they are incurred after
March 21, 2017
:
the cost of drilling geothermal wells; and
expenses incurred solely to determine the extent and quality of a geothermal resource, such as for example, the cost of completing an exploratory well.
2.37.2
However, the cost of completing either (i) a production well or (ii) an exploratory well that is used for production (including small-scale heat or electricity production) will not qualify as CRCE but may form part of the cost of depreciable property and may be eligible for an inclusion in Class 43.2 of the Regulations.
2.37.3
CRCE treatment will be available for expenses in geothermal projects only if, in the year incurred, such expenses meet the requirements of all applicable environmental laws, by-laws and regulations.
Test wind turbines
2.38
Usually, expenditures incurred for the acquisition and installation of depreciable property do not qualify as CRCE. However, expenditures for a test wind turbine that is part of a wind farm project and that meets the requirements set out in
subsection 1219(3)
of the Regulations will qualify as CRCE.
2.39
In order for a wind turbine to qualify as a test wind turbine, the taxpayer must obtain a joint determination from the CRA and NRCan with respect to the legislative requirements in
subsection 1219(3)
of the Regulations. For more information, refer to the NRCan
Technical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)
.
2.40
Generally, a test wind turbine must:
otherwise meet the requirements of a wind energy conversion system under
subparagraph (d)(v)
of
Class 43.1
;
be installed at the site of a planned wind farm project;
meet certain spacing and capacity requirements; and
test the level of electrical energy production from wind prior to the construction of the wind farm project.
2.41
There can be more than one test wind turbine for each wind farm project.
General overview – deductions
2.42
Expenditures incurred by a taxpayer that qualify as CRCE are CEE and are reported on the
Form T2Sch12
. These expenditures are added to the taxpayer’s CCEE pool and may be deducted by the taxpayer in the
tax year
that they are incurred or carried forward indefinitely for deduction in future
tax years
.

Any consideration received by a taxpayer for property or services, the cost of which was CRCE, will be deducted from the taxpayer’s CCEE pool under
subsection 66(12.1)
. For example, if the taxpayer has disposed of feasibility studies, the cost of which previously qualified as
CEE(CRCE)
, the taxpayer will reduce its CCEE pool by the amount of the consideration received.

Partnerships
2.44
A partnership cannot deduct CRCE. Instead, the partner’s CEE(CRCE) will include its share of the partnership’s CEE (CRCE), if the taxpayer is a member of the partnership at the end of the partnership’s fiscal period. For more information on partnerships, refer to
Income Tax Folio S4-F16-C1, What is a Partnership?
2.45
A taxpayer who disposes of all of its interest in a partnership during the partnership fiscal period does not share in the partnership’s
CEE(CRCE)
for that fiscal period. Similarly, any portion of
CEE(CRCE)
of the partnership that has been included in a partner’s
CEE(CRCE)
cannot be transferred to a third party who acquires the partnership interest.
2.46
The partner adds its share of the partnership’s
CEE(CRCE)
to its own CCEE pool.  Under
clause 53(2)(c)(ii)(C)
, the adjusted cost base of the partner’s partnership interest is reduced to reflect the partner’s share of the partnership’s
CEE(CRCE)
.
Acquisition of control
2.47
Where a corporation is subject to an acquisition of control, the CCEE pool that exists immediately before the acquisition of control becomes subject to the successor rules in
section 66.7
(
successored CCEE
). After the acquisition of control, the successor corporation may deduct the successored CCEE only to the extent of production income from a Canadian resource property as defined in
subsection 66(15)
that is owned by the corporation immediately before the acquisition of control. For more information on Canadian resource properties refer to
Interpretation Bulletin IT-125R4 (Archived) – Dispositions of Resource Properties
and
¶1.21
of
Income Tax Folio S3-F8-C1
.
2.48
A taxpayer who is a PBC operating in clean energy generation and energy conservation industries may have CCEE but will likely not own Canadian resource property. Therefore, after the acquisition of control, successored CCEE will become unusable. To address this issue, the taxpayer is entitled to claim the maximum available CEE in the
tax year
that ends immediately before the acquisition of control according to
subsection 66.1(3)
. This may create a
non-capital
loss that could be deducted in future
tax years
subject to certain restrictions. For more information concerning the loss restriction rules, refer to
Interpretation Bulletin IT-232R3, Losses - Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years
.

Flow-through shares – subsection 66(15)
2.49
FTSs help corporations that are PBCs which operate in the clean energy generation and energy conservation industries to finance their development activities. A PBC may renounce expenditures that qualify as CRCE to its investors who subscribe for FTSs. The possibility of renouncing CRCE is of particular advantage to PBCs that are not currently taxable, as it allows the PBC to transfer the resource expenses to the investor. For more information, refer to
Income Tax Folio S3-F8-C1
and the CRA web page,
Flow-through shares (FTSs)
.
Guide T100 – Instructions for the Flow-Through Share Program
provides information on reporting procedures regarding the
flow-through
share program.
Principal-business corporation defined in subsection 66(15)
2.50
In the context of clean energy generation and energy conservation industries, a PBC includes a corporation the principal business of which is any of, or a combination of:
the generation or distribution of energy, or the production of fuel using property described in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
, and
the development of projects for which it is reasonable to expect that at least
50%
of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in each project would qualify for inclusion in
Class 43.1
or 43.2
.
2.51
A PBC also includes a corporation, all or substantially all of the assets of which are shares or debt of another PBC that is related to the corporation otherwise than because of a right referred to in
paragraph 251(5)(b)
. For more information on related persons, refer to
Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length
.
Flow-through shares
2.52
A share or a right is an FTS under
subsection 66(15)
if:
it is:
a share issued by a PBC (other than a
prescribed share
which is defined in
subsections 6202.1(1)
and (2)
of the Regulations) or
a right to acquire a share of the capital stock of a PBC (other than a
prescribed right
which is defined in
subsections 6202.1(1.1)
and (2.1))
;
it is issued pursuant to a written agreement with an investor under which the PBC agrees to incur CEE(CRCE) in an amount equal to the consideration received for the share or the right and renounce this amount in favour of the investor within a specific period of time; and
it is issued for consideration that does not include property transferred by the investor on a
tax-deferred
basis.
2.53
If the risk of loss to the investor is limited or it may be reasonable to consider that there is an obligation to repay or return all or part of the original investment, these shares or rights are considered prescribed shares or prescribed rights, respectively, and are not FTSs. For more information refer to the CRA web page

:
prescribed energy generation and conservation property which includes all the properties described in
Class 43.1
and 43.2
acquired by the taxpayer
