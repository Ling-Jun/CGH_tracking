Projects should have the goal of commercialization in areas where Canada has a proven advantage.Activities for these projects fall mainly underTechnology Readiness Levels (TRLs)3 to 7 but could cover the whole range of TRLs 1 to 9.Project activities should:develop technologies with clear paths to commercialization infunding priority areasinvolve a high degree of collaboration to enhance:supply chainsties between businesses and academia and/or research bodiesSome examples of eligible network project activities include:creating collaboration among key members in the Canadian R&D community. These key members include:industry researchersnational and regional research institutesacademic institutionsCanadian businesses (such as small-and-medium-sized enterprises and large corporations)providing financial support for collaborative projectsNetworks are responsible for assessing, approving and managing the project activities they will support.Collaborative technology development and demonstrationThese types of projects are chosen through acompetitive intake process only.Chosen projects must support industrial research, including:activities related to the discovery of new knowledge (that support the development of new technology-driven products, processes or services at early-stage technology readiness levels)large-scale technology demonstration (such as advancing and developing new technologies into product-specific applications at mid- to-late-stage technology readiness levels)Activities for these projects should fall underTechnology Readiness Levels (TRLs)1 to 7.These projects should:support the development and demonstration of pre-commercial technologiesinvolve a high degree of collaboration enhancing the supply chain and ties between academia and/or research bodiesA project of this type could, for example:in conjunction with small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) suppliers and research councils, develop a leading tier-1 original equipment manufacturing company of a potential new product using academic research findings.Eligible activities for this type of network project are those that provide financial support for collaborative projects and allow for collaboration among key players in the Canadian R&D community, including:industry researchersnational and regional research institutesacademic institutionssmall-and-medium-sized enterprises (SME) or multi-national enterprisesFor network projects, networks are solely responsible for assessing, approving and managing the projects they will support.Related linksProject requirementsAbout the programHow to applyInvestmentsReport a problemDate modified:2025-01-27
