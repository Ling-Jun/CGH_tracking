Collaborations and Networks projects
From:
Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada
Projects funded under the
Collaborations and Networks
category of the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) foster large, collaborative business-led projects and innovation networks in areas where Canada has a demonstrated advantage.
Learn more about the
Networks that SIF funding has created
.
To apply to SIF as a lead applicant in the Collaborations and Networks category, your organization must be one of the following:
a not-for-profit organization incorporated in Canada
a for-profit corporation incorporated in Canada
As the lead applicant, if you are successful in receiving SIF funding, you will be responsible for managing the project for the network according to the terms of the Contribution Agreement. This includes:
submitting an application to SIF on behalf of the network
receiving and managing the government contribution
managing the network's projects and distribution of funding

Types of Collaborations and Networks projects
National innovation networks
Projects related to the development of national networks can support multiple projects.
Resulting network-supported projects may include:
Industrial research:
This includes activities related to the discovery of new knowledge that aim to support the development of new technology-driven products.
Processes or services at early-stage technology readiness levels:
This includes fundamental research activities and the research and development (R&D) phases.
Technology demonstration:
This includes advancing and developing new technologies into product-specific applications at mid- and late-stage technology readiness levels. Projects should have the goal of commercialization in areas where Canada has a proven advantage.
Activities for these projects fall mainly under
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
3 to 7 but could cover the whole range of TRLs 1 to 9.
Project activities should:
develop technologies with clear paths to commercialization in
funding priority areas
involve a high degree of collaboration to enhance:
supply chains
ties between businesses and academia and/or research bodies
Some examples of eligible network project activities include:
creating collaboration among key members in the Canadian R&D community. These key members include:
industry researchers
national and regional research institutes
academic institutions
Canadian businesses (such as small-and-medium-sized enterprises and large corporations)
providing financial support for collaborative projects
Networks are responsible for assessing, approving and managing the project activities they will support.
Collaborative technology development and demonstration
These types of projects are chosen through a
competitive intake process only
.
Chosen projects must support industrial research, including:
activities related to the discovery of new knowledge (that support the development of new technology-driven products, processes or services at early-stage technology readiness levels)
large-scale technology demonstration (such as advancing and developing new technologies into product-specific applications at mid- to-late-stage technology readiness levels)
Activities for these projects should fall under
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
1 to 7.
These projects should:
support the development and demonstration of pre-commercial technologies
involve a high degree of collaboration enhancing the supply chain and ties between academia and/or research bodies
A project of this type could, for example:
the lead applicant working in conjunction with small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) suppliers and research councils, develop a leading tier-1 original equipment manufacturing company of a potential new product using academic research findings.
Eligible activities for this type of network project are those that provide financial support for collaborative projects and allow for collaboration among key players in the Canadian R&D community, including:
industry researchers
national and regional research institutes
academic institutions
small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SME) or multi-national enterprises
For network projects, networks are solely responsible for assessing, approving and managing the projects they will support.
