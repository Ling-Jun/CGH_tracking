Public Transit
Réseau express métropolitain (REM)
Greener transit reduces emissions in Canada, provides citizens with cleaner and faster commutes and improves the quality of life for Canadians, particularly those living in larger cities.
We are working with public transit owners and service providers across the country regarding zero-emission buses (ZEBs), light rail transit, bus rapid transit, subways, transit-oriented development and more.
