Overview
Innovation continues to foster new and creative solutions in public transportation that support a cleaner environment, while increasing the mobility of Canadians. Helping communities invest in zero emission transit and school transportation options will provide communities with environmental and health benefits by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.

The transportation sector accounts for 25% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. Canada generates approximately 82% of its electricity from zero emission power sources. Shifting vehicles away from fossil fuel engines, towards zero emission alternatives, presents an opportunity for significant greenhouse gas emission reductions.
While many transit and school bus operators are pursuing fleet electrification, the transition can be challenging due to the complexities of converting entire transit systems to a new technology, which involves significant upfront costs associated to Zero Emission Buses and related ancillary infrastructure.
To bridge this gap, the Zero Emission Transit Fund offers support to public transit and school bus operators across Canada who are electrifying their fleets. The Zero Emission Transit Fund also delivers on the federal government's commitment to help purchase 5,000 zero emission buses. This Fund is closely coordinated with the Canada Infrastructure Bank's (CIB) Zero Emission Bus Initiative through which the
CIB
has committed more than $1.5 billion to supporting the deployment of zero emission buses.
Fund details
Through the Zero Emission Transit Fund, the Government of Canada is supporting public transit and school bus operators plan for electrification, support the purchase of 5,000 zero emission buses and build associated infrastructure, including charging infrastructure and facility upgrades.
What types of projects will be funded under the Zero Emission Transit Fund?
There are two Zero Emission Transit Fund components under which projects are eligible for funding:
Planning Projects: Eligible projects include studies, modelling and feasibility analysis that will support the development of future larger scale capital projects.
Capital Projects: Eligible capital projects include buses, charging and refueling infrastructure, and other supporting infrastructure needs.
Who can apply?
Eligible recipients under the Zero Emission Transit Fund include:
provinces and territories;
municipal or regional governments;
transit agencies;
public bodies (e.g., school boards);
private-sector school bus operators;
and private accessible transit transportation providers (e.g., paratransit services).
Note:  It should be noted that discussions are ongoing between the Government of  Canada and the Government of Quebec regarding the implementation of this  program in Quebec, in accordance with the Quebec legislative framework.
How will  Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada select projects for funding?
Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada will review submitted applications, and applicants will be selected based on their eligibility as well as the assessment against the merit criteria established for the Zero Emission Transit Fund. Further details are provided within the
Applicant Guide
.
How will this funding work with existing transit-focused funding under the Investing in Canada plan?
The Zero Emission Transit Fund is a separate fund that builds on existing programming such as the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream of the
Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program
.  Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada will continue to work directly with provinces and territories to review and approve funding for prioritized projects under Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.
How will  Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada and the Canada Infrastructure Bank work together?
Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada and the
CIB
will work in collaboration in order to support the transition to zero emission buses. Through the Zero Emission Transit Fund,  Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada provides funding contributions to support planning and capital projects that will reduce the barriers to procuring zero emission transit and school buses in Canada. Through its Zero-emission Bus initiative, the
CIB
has committed more than $1.5 billion to support the deployment of zero emission buses. The
CIB
provides flexible financing solutions by leveraging forecasted lifecycle operational cost savings to help offset the higher upfront costs of zero emission buses. Project applications submitted as part of the application process will be assessed by both  Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada and the
CIB
.
How will the Zero Emission Transit Fund assist with moving to zero emission transit?
The Zero Emission Transit Fund will help remove key barriers impeding the deployment of zero emission buses through providing funding for planning, the procurement of buses and ancillary infrastructure required to support zero emission buses.
How to apply
For detailed information on the Zero Emission Transit Fund, including applicant and project eligibility requirements and instructions about how to apply for funding, please read the
Applicant Guide
.
Interested applicants are invited to apply to the Zero Emission Transit Fund by creating an account on the
Applicant Portal

guidance modules
Fleet electrification presents a number of benefits such as greenhouse gas emissions reductions and environmental and health benefits from the decrease in toxic diesel emissions. When applying to the Zero Emission Transit Fund, applicants will be required to complete an assessment of the environmental benefits of their project. This will allow them to quantify the benefits of fleet electrification and demonstrate how zero emission bus deployments can support Canada in achieving its emission reduction targets.
The Greenhouse Gas
+ PLUS
Guidance Modules provide information to help quantify greenhouse gas emission and air pollutant reductions from the implementation of new zero emission buses. It also provides guidance on assessing the adaptation and resilience of the zero emission bus project to a changing climate. The Greenhouse Gas
+ PLUS
Guidance Modules will support applicants in filling out their project application forms and is to be submitted as part of the application process under the Zero Emission Transit Fund.
