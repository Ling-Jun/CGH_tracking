Thrive Lab for Women
We believe supporting
women-led
businesses who seek to create positive social outcomes will bring meaningful change and positive returns. We are equally committed to building a community of investment partners who share our ambition to increase access to investment capital for women changemakers. Working with
like-minded
partners, we will invest in
women-led
impact-driven
companies with promising business models and support them in pursuing their growth.
Be the change
The Thrive Lab will provide
$100 million
in equity and
equity-like
investments to
women-led
businesses. These companies seek to make a social impact that is tied to the UN Sustainable Development Goals such as food security and responsible agriculture, health and
well-being,
education, reduced inequalities, and responsible consumption and production.
How the Lab works
As a collaborative Lab, we work
with 25
co-investment
partners who are responsible to source,
pre-qualify
and recommend women led business for us to invest in.
Working with these partners, every company we invest in will be well supported with capital, resources, and mentors, dedicated to help them grow and achieve their impact goals.
Our goal is to innovate, experiment, and adapt to expand the capital available in the marketplace for women-led businesses making a difference.

impact-driven

Initial focus on businesses at their earliest stage of development who will achieve their objectives while generating a financial return
