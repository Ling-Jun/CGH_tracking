FAQ
The REGI program offers two options for funding:
Business Scale-up and Productivity
Regional Innovation Ecosystems
Business Scale-up and Productivity
We help businesses speed up their growth so they can be more productive, compete on the world stage and reach new markets.
REGI can help you reach the next level! Our repayment contributions are unsecured and interest-free. Your agreement will explain all the details including the schedule and conditions for repayment.
You can use this funding to:
scale up and expand
make the most of new technologies
improve productivity
create new products and find new markets
Regional Innovation Ecosystems
ACOA funds non-profit organizations that support businesses at each stage of development. By doing this, we create strong and inclusive regional networks to fuel growth and innovation.
We also focus on making business support networks stronger for under-represented groups. These include women, Indigenous peoples and young entrepreneurs, among others.
We provide non-repayable contributions for organizations such as:
strategic clusters and groups that help businesses build on regional strengths to scale up and bring new ideas to market
business accelerators and incubators and others that support entrepreneurs, start-ups and innovative companies with high-growth potential
other innovation-oriented organizations that help businesses be more productive, compete globally, attract new investments and recruit talent
Who can apply?

sole proprietorships
