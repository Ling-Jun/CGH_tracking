Regional Quantum Initiative (RQI) in the Prairie Provinces
As part of the Government of Canada’s efforts to develop a National Quantum Strategy (NQS), Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) is delivering the Regional Quantum Initiative (RQI) in Alberta. This fund will help companies and not-for-profit organizations advance and commercialize quantum products and solutions for domestic and global markets.
The Regional Quantum Initiative advances PrairiesCan’s strategic priorities. As one of four regional hubs of Canadian expertise in the field of quantum technologies, Alberta is well-positioned to transform research into products and processes. The Alberta region has strengths in quantum computing, materials, sensors and communications technology.
Quantum science is the study, manipulation and control of systems at the atomic and subatomic level. It can lead to transformative technologies in fields such as computing, sensors, secure communications and advanced materials development.
Quantum technology is at the leading edge of science and innovation, with enormous potential for commercialization. In addition to helping transform the Canadian economy, quantum technologies have the potential to help advance a wide range of benefits for Canadians, including:
the design and delivery of new medicines, vaccines and next-generation batteries;
more efficient and secure supply chains and digital communication;
new greener products and new approaches to model, track and forecast climate change.
Areas of focus for RQI include:
quantum computing;
quantum sensors;
quantum communications technology;
quantum materials.
