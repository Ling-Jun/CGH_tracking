Ghost Gear Fund supported projects
The Government of Canada, working with partners and stakeholders, has made significant progress in tackling lost fishing gear, known as ghost gear, in Canada and abroad through the Ghost Gear Program.
Between 2020 and 2024, DFO has provided more than $58.3M to 143 projects; 134 within Canada and 9 internationally, to assist Indigenous groups, fish harvesters, the aquaculture industry, non-government organizations, and communities in taking concrete action in the fight against ghost gear.
