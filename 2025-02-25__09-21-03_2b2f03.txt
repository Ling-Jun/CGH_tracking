Ghost Gear Fund supported projectsThe Government of Canada, working with partners and stakeholders, has made significant progress in tackling lost fishing gear, known as ghost gear, in Canada and abroad through the Ghost Gear Program.Between 2020 and 2024, DFO has provided more than $58.3M to 143 projects; 134 within Canada and 9 internationally, to assist Indigenous groups, fish harvesters, the aquaculture industry, non-government organizations, and communities in taking concrete action in the fight against ghost gear.Funded projects:Interactive map2020-20222022-20232023-20242022-2024 â Hurricane Fiona ResponseProject photo galleryAll projects fall under at least one of four pillars of activity:Ghost gear retrievalRetrieval projects will identify areas known to have high levels of reported lost fishing gear, and work to remove as much gear from the water as possible. Some retrieval projects will target clean-ups to areas that are known habitat for species at risk. Projects will also seek out areas where the reported lost gear will have a greater impact on the surrounding environment, such as gillnets, pots and traps. Other types of lost gear, including longlines, hook and line, trawls and seines will also be targeted for retrieval.Responsible disposalDisposal projects will work with relevant partners (ports, industry, etc.) to identify and facilitate measures or activities related to the responsible disposal and recycling of ghost gear and end-of-life fishing gear. To reduce the amount of fishing gear ending up in landfills, projects will include:working with recycling and waste facilitiesidentifying transportation and storing optionscoming up with creative solutionsAcquisition and piloting of available technologyThese projects encourage the acquisition and/or piloting of market-ready technologies aimed at prevention, reduction, and retrieval of ghost gear. For the fishing industry, this includes:opportunities to pilot market-ready technologies in Canadian fisheries to determine whether it allows for alternative solutionsaddress gaps in current gear usedlimit impacts on the marine environment (including known habitat for species at risk)whether it is an economically viable option for the industryInternational leadershipInternational projects involve working with a recognized international body or organization to help developing or small island states establish their own sustainable fisheries practices and programs to mitigate the impact of ghost gear. These projects must also fall into at least one of the other three Ghost Gear Fund pillars of activity (retrieval, disposal or technology), and help work towards long-term solutions in the regions where the work will be completed. International hotspots for ghost gear include the Caribbean, South Pacific, and West African coast.Date modified:2024-10-28
