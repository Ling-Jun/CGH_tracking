Non‑eligible project participants (e.g. universities, research institutes, etc., and participants from other countries) are welcome to participate on a self‑funded basis or as sub‑contractors to funded participants, according to each country's funding regulations.
Additional country-specific funding parameters are outlined below.
5.1 Canadian funding
In Canada, this call for proposals is offered through the
Canadian International Innovation Program
(CIIP) - an international innovation R&D funding program offered by Global Affairs Canada in partnership with the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance
Program (NRC IRAP).
NRC IRAP is responsible for delivering this call for proposals and for managing any resulting funding agreements.
Canadian SMEs
Eligible Canadian SMEs may receive up to 50% reimbursement of eligible project costs up to a maximum total funding amount of $600,000 CAD over

Note:
Canadian SME applicants must be eligible for funding as NRC IRAP clients before they can be considered for funding through this call for proposals. For more information on NRC IRAP eligibility and becoming an NRC IRAP client, please contact NRC IRAP at
1-877-994-4727.
Note:
Canadian SME applicants may apply to more than one NRC IRAP call for proposals simultaneously. However, NRC IRAP may limit the number of funded projects per applicant. Canadian SME applicants who are applying to more than one opportunity or who have ongoing NRC IRAP projects should speak to their NRC IRAP representative for more information.
5.2 Taiwanese funding
In Taiwan, this call for proposals is offered by the Department of Industrial Technology (DoIT) in partnership with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). The funding is provided by the DoIT while ITRI is responsible for facilitating and promoting the call for proposals.
Please consult the Taiwan
call for proposals announcement (available in Chinese only)
for Taiwanese funding parameters.
6. Application process
Each project partner
seeking funding must submit all required documents to their respective national funding body and meet its due diligence process requirements. Failure to do so, at any point or for any reason, may cause the entire collaborative project application to be considered incomplete or ineligible and render the entire project consortium ineligible for funding through this call for proposals.
Application processes and evaluations will be performed independently by each national funding body in accordance with their national and institutional laws and regulations. Once each national funding body has evaluated the submitted applications, a final joint project selection will be performed.
Information on respective application processes follows below:
6.1 Canadian application process
The Canadian application process has four phases:
Registration
Expression of interest
International consortium project proposal
National funding body proposal and funding agreement
Step 1: Registration phase
Each Canadian SME applicant must register using the
Register
button at the bottom of this page. Basic information about the applicant and the organization will be required upon registration.
NRC IRAP will review registrations for this call for proposals and contact applicants if more information is required. Qualifying applicants will proceed to the next phase and be invited to submit an expression of interest form.
Step 2: Expression of interest (EOI) phase
During this phase, each Canadian SME applicant seeking funding must submit an expression of interest (EOI) form outlining basic information on the applicant and the collaborative project.
While completing the EOI form, each Canadian SME applicant is encouraged to contact their NRC IRAP representative to discuss their project idea and receive guidance on preparing their submission.
It is recommended that applicants submit the EOI as early as possible. EOIs will be evaluated by the applicant's NRC IRAP representative and the NRC IRAP International Office. Qualifying applicants will be invited to submit the more detailed international consortium project proposal in collaboration with their project partners. The lead Canadian SME applicant will be provided all templates needed to submit an international consortium project proposal (ICPP).
Step 3: International consortium project proposal (ICPP) phase
During this phase, all project partners must work together to complete and submit an ICPP package.
In this call for proposals, the Canadian ICPP application package consists of:
an
International Consortium Project Proposal
outlining the:
project consortium
collaborative project
expected outcomes
expected project cost and calendar
a
draft international consortium agreement
containing descriptions of the following:
roles and responsibilities of each consortium member
project management framework
division of intellectual property rights
confidentiality and publication agreements, and liability clauses
Canadian ICPP applications will be evaluated by an NRC IRAP evaluation team including the applicant's NRC IRAP representative and the NRC IRAP International Office. Only Canadian participants of selected project proposals will be invited to proceed to the final national funding body proposal and funding agreement stage.
Step 4: National funding body proposal and funding agreement phase
During the national funding body proposal and funding agreement phase, all eligible project partners work independently to complete funding proposals and sign legally binding funding agreements with their respective national funding body. Canadian SME applicants will work with their NRC IRAP representative to prepare an NRC IRAP funding proposal and contribution agreement.
