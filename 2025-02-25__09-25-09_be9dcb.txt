The lead Canadian SME applicant will be provided all templates needed to submit an international consortium project proposal (ICPP).Step 3: International consortium project proposal (ICPP) phaseDuring this phase, all project partners must work together to complete and submit an ICPP package.In this call for proposals, the Canadian ICPP application package consists of:anInternational Consortium Project Proposaloutlining the:project consortiumcollaborative projectexpected outcomesexpected project cost and calendaradraft international consortium agreementcontaining descriptions of the following:roles and responsibilities of each consortium memberproject management frameworkdivision of intellectual property rightsconfidentiality and publication agreements, and liability clausesCanadian ICPP applications will be evaluated by an NRC IRAP evaluation team including the applicant's NRC IRAP representative and the NRC IRAP International Office. Only Canadian participants of selected project proposals will be invited to proceed to the final national funding body proposal and funding agreement stage.Step 4: National funding body proposal and funding agreement phaseDuring the national funding body proposal and funding agreement phase, all eligible project partners work independently to complete funding proposals and sign legally binding funding agreements with their respective national funding body. Canadian SME applicants will work with their NRC IRAP representative to prepare an NRC IRAP funding proposal and contribution agreement.6.2 Taiwan application processFor information related to application stages, requirements, instructions, ICPP application packages and funding agreements, please consult the Taiwanesecall for proposals announcement (available in Chinese only).7.
