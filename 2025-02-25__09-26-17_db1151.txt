This creates environmental, social and economic benefits to support healthier and more sustainable communities.Investing in clean energy solutions in Indigenous communities is a  small but important link to energy security, reconciliation, self-determination  and economic development for Indigenous Peoples.Changing how we work to support community prioritiesTo improve community access to federal clean energy funding  and resources, multiple departments are changing how we work.What  does this mean for applicants?One application that you can submit for either CERRC or the Northern Responsible Energy Approach  for Community Heat and Electricity program (REACHE), available on theClean energy for Indigenous, rural and remote communitieswebsiteSimplified project reportingMore flexible Terms + ConditionsAn Indigenous Council to guide our work starting  in fall 2022On-going conversations and information sessions  to improve program delivery and work towards Indigenous Climate LeadershipPreviously funded projectsLaunched in 2018, the CERRC program was allocated $220 million over 8 years to reduce diesel reliance for heat and power in Indigenous and remote communities. CERRC received an additional $233 million over 5 years through Budget 2021. The program has supported 111 projects nationally, including capacity building initiatives, large capital projects, innovation projects, and bioheat projects.

Check out the list ofcurrently funded projects.NRCan’sIndigenous Off-Diesel Initiativesupports 14  Indigenous clean energy champions and their communities and has provided over  $28 million for community clean energy planning, engagement, and implementing  projects. This initiative is delivered in collaboration with theIndigenous  Clean Energy Social Enterpriseand thePembina Institute.Background  about diesel use in rural and remote communitiesRural and remote communities that are not connected to the North  American electricity grid often use diesel and fossil fuels to generate heat and  power. Using fossil fuels for heat and power is expensive and has an impact on  the environment, including air quality.Energy efficiency and conservation measures can help to reduce overall  demand for fossil fuels, create warmer, healthier homes and provide savings to  communities. Cost savings can enable communities to invest in other  community-driven priorities. Local renewable energy sources such as wind,  solar, hydro or biomass can replace diesel, reduce environmental and health  impacts, and create local economic opportunities.Find out which  energy sources are used by rural and remote communities by visiting theAtlas  of Canada - Remote Communities Energy Database.Definition of rural and remote communitiesRural  communityis defined as a community connected to the North American electrical grid and not connected to the North American piped natural gas network, with a population of fewer than 5,000 people and a population density of less than 400 people per square kilometre. A permanent or long-term (5 years or more) settlement with at least 10 dwellings.Remote  communityis defined as a community not currently connected to the North American electrical grid nor to the piped natural gas network and which is a permanent or long-term (5 years or more) settlement with at least 10 dwellings. Includes all Northern Remote Communities.ResourcesIf you  are a project lead or team member working with NRCan on clean energy projects  in Indigenous, rural and remote communities,email  us to jointhe regular networking events at theClean Energy Circle.Learn moreabout renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that arecurrently funded by CERRC.Related linksFindings: The Clean Energy Transition for Utilities Serving Remote CommunitiesContact UsSign-upfor ourmailing listto receive program updates  and learn about upcoming events.
