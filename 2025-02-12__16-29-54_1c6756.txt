Northern REACHE is a part ofWah-ila-toos, a new way to improve community access to federal clean energy programming.New funding availableIn April 2022, the Government of Canada announced $300 million in funding to support communities launching clean energy projects such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and biomass along with a new, streamlined service model for communities seeking to access resources and clean energy funding. This initiative,newly gifted the name Wah-ila-toos in a traditional naming ceremony, is a partnership between Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) and Indigenous Services Canada (ISC), with support from Infrastructure Canada, and Environment and Climate Change Canada.To learn more about the types of projects we're funding, who can apply and how we're working, visitWah-ila-toos: Funding opportunities.On this pageAbout the programFunding for hydroelectricity feasibility and planningChanging how we work to support community prioritiesPreviously selected projectsBackgroundRelated linksAbout the programThe Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Electricity program, also called the Northern REACHE program, funds renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, and related capacity building and planning in:YukonNorthwest TerritoriesNunavutNunavikNunatsiavutThe program objective is to reduce Northern communities' reliance on diesel for heating and electricity by increasing the use of local renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. This will result in environmental, social and economic benefits to support developing healthier, more sustainable Northern communities.Investing in clean energy solutions in Indigenous communities is an important link to energy security, reconciliation and self-determination for Indigenous peoples.Funding for hydroelectricity feasibility and planningAnnounced in Budget 2021, Northern REACHE will provide $40.4 million, until 2024, to support the feasibility and planning stages of hydroelectricity and grid interconnection projects in the North.You can contact us ataadnc.northernreache.aandc@canada.cafor more information or to request an application guide.There is no deadline to apply.
