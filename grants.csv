It also does not apply to Classes 43.1, 43.2 and 53 (or to Class 43 in respect of property acquired after 2025 that would have been included in Class 53 if it had been acquired in 2025), as they benefit from the full expensing measures. For more information, see the full expensing measures.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-The incentive's general rule is made up of two elements:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-applying the prescribed CCA rate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the year</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-suspending the CCA half-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property)</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-As a result, EP that would be subject to the half-year rule, in essence, qualifies for an enhanced first-year allowance equal to three times the normal first-year deduction. EP not normally subject to the half-year rule (for example, a patent, franchise or limited-period licence) qualifies for one-and-a-half times the normal first-year deduction. For more information, see Example 3.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-If the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of a class increases in a year by an investment in both EP and non-eligible property (NEP), and an amount (for example, a disposition) decreases the UCC of the class, you must first reduce the cost of NEP additions before reducing the cost of EP additions. For more information, see Example 5.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-The incentive applies to property for which CCA is calculated on a:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-declining-balance basis (for example, intangible property, included in Class 14.1)</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-straight-line depreciation (for example, leasehold improvements, patents, and limited period licences)</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Effect of the enhanced first-year allowance in the following years</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-The AII does not change the total amount that you can deduct over the life of a property. By claiming a larger CCA deduction in the first year, you will have smaller CCA deductions in future years.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-For classes where the CCA is calculated on a declining-balance basis, the incentive will automatically reduce the UCC available in respect of the property in subsequent years.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-For CCA classes with straight-line depreciation, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in a year will not affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years, until such time as the UCC is fully exhausted.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Example 1</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Where the calculated rate of a class with straight-line depreciation is 20% and there is only one property in the class, and it is an EP addition, you are entitled to deduct 30% (in other words, one-and-a-half times 20%) of the capital cost of the property in the first year, 20% in each of the second through fourth years and 10% (in other words, the remainder) in the fifth year.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Certain resource-related assets can depreciate based on unit of use. You can generally claim CCA based on the portion of the resources depleted in each year.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-For properties depreciated on a unit-of-use basis, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in the first year will not affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years until such time as the UCC is fully exhausted.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Example 2</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-If you use 10% of a resource in the first year, you will be able to deduct 15% of its capital cost in the first year. After the first year, you will be eligible to deduct the cost in proportion to the amount of the resource depleted in each year to a maximum of 100% of the cost of the resource. The enhanced first-year allowance will reduce the amount of deduction you can claim in the final year.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Application and phase-out</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-You must acquire the EP after November 20, 2018, and it must be available for use before 2028 in order to qualify for the AII. A phase-out period begins for property that becomes available for use after 2023.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-For EP that would normally be subject to the half-year rule (or an equivalent rule) and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is reduced to two times the normal first-year CCA deduction. The incentive effectively suspends the half-year rule (and equivalent rules). In essence, you can calculate CCA at the rate relevant to that class without applying the half-year rule.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-For EP that would not normally be subject to the half-year rule (or an equivalent rule), and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is generally equal to one-and-a-quarter times the normal first-year CCA deduction.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-You can claim the enhanced first-year allowance in respect of an EP only in the first tax year that the property becomes available for use.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-As a result, as shown in examples 3 to 6, an enhanced first-year allowance of up to three times the normal first-year CCA deduction is available for property that would otherwise be subject to the half-year rule. The enhanced first-year allowance is reduced to two times the normal first-year CCA deduction in the 2024–2027 phase-out period as seen in Example 6.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Example 3</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-You acquire a Class 10 (30%) property for $300 in 2021, and it becomes available for use in that year.

In general, the incentive is made up of two elements:applying the prescribedCCArate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the year.suspending theCCAhalf-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property).Full expensing for manufacturers and processors– Allowing businesses to immediatelywrite off the full cost of machinery and equipmentused for the manufacturing or processing of goods (Class 53).Full expensing for clean energy investments– Allowing businesses to immediatelywrite off the full cost of specified clean energy equipment(Classes 43.1 and 43.2).You must acquire the eligible property after November 20, 2018, and it must be available for usebefore2028 in order to qualify for the measures.For more restrictions on property, seeRestrictions.A phase-out of the measures begins for eligible property that becomes available for use after 2023, though theCCAhalf-year rule effectively remains suspended for such property.For more information, seeApplication and phase-out.Accelerated investment incentiveThe accelerated investment incentive (AII) measure provides an enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible property (EP).The incentive's general rule does not apply to Classes 54, 55 and 56. It also does not apply to Classes 43.1, 43.2 and 53 (or to Class 43 in respect of property acquired after 2025 that would have been included in Class 53 if it had been acquired in 2025), as they benefit from the full expensing measures. For more information, see thefull expensing measures.The incentive's general rule is made up of two elements:applying the prescribedCCArate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the yearsuspending theCCAhalf-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property)As a result,EPthat would be subject to the half-year rule, in essence, qualifies for an enhanced first-year allowance equal tothree timesthe normal first-year deduction.EPnot normally subject to the half-year rule (for example, a patent, franchise or limited-period licence) qualifies forone-and-a-half timesthe normal first-year deduction. For more information, seeExample 3.If the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of a class increases in a year by an investment in bothEPandnon-eligibleproperty (NEP), and an amount (for example, a disposition) decreases theUCCof the class, you must first reduce the cost ofNEPadditions before reducing the cost ofEPadditions. For more information, seeExample 5.The incentiveappliesto property for whichCCAis calculated on a:declining-balance basis (for example, intangible property, included in Class 14.1)straight-line depreciation (for example, leasehold improvements, patents, and limited period licences)Effect of the enhanced first-year allowance in the following yearsTheAIIdoesnotchange the total amount that you can deduct over the life of a property. By claiming a largerCCAdeduction in the first year, you will have smallerCCAdeductions in future years.For classes where theCCAis calculated on a declining-balance basis, the incentive will automatically reduce theUCCavailable in respect of the property in subsequent years.ForCCAclasses with straight-line depreciation, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in a year will not affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years, until such time as theUCCis fully exhausted.Example 1Where the calculated rate of a class with straight-line depreciation is 20% and there is only one property in the class, and it is anEPaddition, you are entitled to deduct 30% (in other words, one-and-a-half times 20%) of the capital cost of the property in the first year, 20% in each of the second through fourth years and 10% (in other words, the remainder) in the fifth year.Certainresource-relatedassets can depreciate based on unit of use. You can generally claimCCAbased on the portion of the resources depleted in each year.For properties depreciated on aunit-of-usebasis, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in the first year willnotaffect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years until such time as theUCCis fully exhausted.Example 2If you use 10% of a resource in the first year, you will be able to deduct 15% of its capital cost in the first year. After the first year, you will be eligible to deduct the cost in proportion to the amount of the resource depleted in each year to a maximum of 100% of the cost of the resource. The enhanced first-year allowance will reduce the amount of deduction you can claim in the final year.Application and phase-outYou must acquire theEPafter November 20, 2018, and it must be available for use before 2028 in order to qualify for theAII. A phase-out period begins for property that becomes available for use after 2023.ForEPthatwouldnormallybe subject to the half-year rule(or an equivalent rule) and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is reduced totwo timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction. The incentive effectively suspends the half-year rule (and equivalent rules). In essence, you can calculateCCAat the rate relevant to that class without applying the half-year rule.ForEPthatwould notnormallybe subject to the half-year rule(or an equivalent rule), and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is generally equal toone-and-a-quarter timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction.You can claim the enhanced first-year allowance in respect of anEPonly in the first tax year that the property becomes available for use.As a result, as shown in examples 3 to 6, an enhanced first-year allowance of up tothree timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction is available for property that would otherwise be subject to the half-year rule. The enhanced first-year allowance is reduced totwo timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction in the 2024–2027 phase-out period as seen inExample 6.Example 3You acquire a Class 10 (30%) property for $300 in 2021, and it becomes available for use in that year.

For more information, seeAdditional restrictions.Enhanced first-year deductions in respect of Canadian development expense and Canadian oil and gas property expenseAn enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible Canadian development expenses (CDE) or Canadian oil and gas property expenses (COGPE) incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028. These expenses are not subject to ahalf-yearrule and, thus, qualify for an enhanced first-year deduction equal to one-and-a-half times the normal first-year deduction that would otherwise be available. The additional deduction begins to phase out for expenses incurred after 2023.CDEandCOGPEare also not subject to the available for use rule.NoteAn acceleratedCDEorCOGPEdoes not include an expense that is a successoredCDEor successoredCOGPE(in other words, expenses incurred by a predecessor corporation that a successor corporation is entitled to claim) or that is a cost in respect of a Canadian resource property you, or a partnership in which you are a member, acquired from a person or partnership with which you do not deal at arm's length.RestrictionsShort tax yearsUnder the short tax-year rule, you must generally prorate the maximum amount ofCCAyou can claim if the tax year is less than 12 months. Property eligible for the incentive are also subject to the short tax year rules forCCA.Rules to restrict CCA deductionIn certain situations, there are rules that can restrict aCCAdeduction, or a loss in respect of such a deduction, that would otherwise be available.Some of the rules that continue to apply include rules relating to:limited partnersspecified leasing propertiesspecified energy propertiesrental propertiescomputer software tax shelter ruleslimited recourse debt rulesThis is not an exhaustive list.Additional restrictionsCertain additional restrictions apply toEP. Under theAII, if you acquire property in respect to which aCCAdeduction or a terminal loss has been claimed before you acquired it, it is only eligible for the incentive if both of the following conditions are met:neither you nor a non-arm's length person previously owned the propertythe property has not been transferred to you on a tax-deferred ""rollover"" basisIn other words, properties acquired in non-arm's length and roll-over transactions are not eligible for this incentive. They are consideredNEP.In addition, new rules may apply for certain property constructed over multiple tax years and transferred between non-arm's length parties before it is put in use. Where the capital cost of a single property includes expenditures incurred at different times, and you claimCCAor a terminal loss under special rules with respect to some of these expenditures, the single property will be deemed to be split into separate portions such that the portion for which noCCAor terminal loss has been claimed may be treated as a separate property in the event of a subsequent transfer of the property. As a result, the portion for which noCCAor terminal loss has been claimed may qualify asAIIproperty.Certain property is subject to the half-year rule but other property is excluded, therefore not allNEPare subject to the half-year rule. For more information on the half-year rule, seeIncome Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.Additionally, theAIIdoes not apply for the additional allowance for mining property in Class 41.2. The allowance for mining property is currently being phased out.Full expensing for manufacturing and processing machinery and equipmentCurrently, certain machinery and equipment may qualify for a temporary acceleratedCCArate of 50% calculated on a declining-balance basis under Class 53.

According to subsection 13(18.1), the Technical Guide to Class 43.1 and 43.2, which is published by NRCan, applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters that arise when determining whether a property qualifies for accelerated CCA. The guide provides technical information on eligible properties that meet the requirements of the particular paragraph or subparagraph of Class 43.1, ineligible properties that are specifically excluded from Class 43.1, tables of typical capital costs for the different technologies and the relevant forms necessary to obtain a technical opinion from NRCan on the scientific and engineering requirements.

Due to their technical nature, folios are used primarily by tax specialists and other individuals who have an interest in tax matters. While each paragraph in a chapter of a folio may relate to provisions of the law in force at the time it was written (see the Application section), the information provided is not a substitute for the law.

In establishing whether a particular property is used primarily for the purpose of a given activity, different factors are examined such as the proportion of time that it is used in this activity or the relative proportions of the output that is generated from the property. In addition to this quantitative test, the circumstances may require a qualitative assessment of the taxpayer’s main purpose in using the property.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.3 Generally, the phrase all or substantially all means at least 90%.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Accelerated CCA</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.4 A taxpayer may claim CCA only on property described in Schedule II of the Regulations that was acquired for the purpose of earning income.

A taxpayer can claim it only for the year in which the eligible property first becomes available for use. Generally, property described in Class 43.1 or 43.2 which is acquired after November 20, 2018 and put into use before 2028 will meet the definition of accelerated investment property in subsection 1104(4) of the Regulations. Such property will be eligible for the first-year enhanced CCA if all other requirements are met.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-General rules</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.5 Clean energy generation and energy conservation technologies are a key component of the Government’s approach to promoting sustainable economic growth and can contribute to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. One way to promote these technologies is to allow a business to reduce its taxable income in the early years of an asset’s operation by claiming CCA at a high rate. This accelerated CCA is an exception to the general practice of setting CCA rates based on the useful life of an asset.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.6 Class 43.1 and Class 43.2 of Schedule II of the Regulations provide accelerated CCA rates for qualifying investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment situated in Canada. Class 43.1 is the permanent class and has a 30% CCA rate on a declining balance basis. This Class includes a detailed description of the different types of eligible properties.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.7 Class 43.2 has a 50% CCA rate on a declining balance basis. Most of the equipment that is described in Class 43.1 will qualify for the 50% CCA rate under Class 43.2 when the property is acquired before 2025. However, the following equipment only qualifies for the 30% CCA rate in Class 43.1:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-mid-efficiency, fully or partially fossil-fuelled cogeneration systems;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-electric vehicle charging stations set up to supply more than 10 kW but less than 90 kW of continuous power; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-electrical energy storage equipment connected to one of the above systems and stand-alone electrical energy storage systems meeting particular efficiency requirements.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.8 Where a depreciable property qualifies for Class 43.1 or 43.2, it cannot be included in another class even though the property may otherwise meet the requirements of that other class.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.9 Class 43.1 deals with the following two broad categories of equipment as listed in the Table of eligible properties:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-equipment described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of Class 43.1; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-equipment described in any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (d) of Class 43.1.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.10 Eligible input sources for equipment included in Class 43.1 or 43.2 are:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal, wave or tidal energy;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-eligible waste fuels defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations such as biogas, bio-oil, digester gas, landfill gas, municipal waste, plant residue, pulp and paper waste, and wood waste or producer gas and in some cases spent pulping liquor; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-fossil fuels (other than solution gas) where the designated heat rate is satisfied and in certain other situations described in subparagraph (d)(ix) of Class 43.1.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Property eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.2</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.11 The depreciable property must:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-be situated in Canada;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-be acquired by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada or from property situated in Canada, or the property must be acquired by a taxpayer in order to be leased to a lessee who will use the property for the same income earning purpose; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-subject to certain exceptions, not have been used for any purpose before the taxpayer acquired the property.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.12 Reconditioned and remanufactured equipment is excluded from Class 43.1 or 43.2 even if the reconditioning makes the equipment more energy efficient by current standards.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.13 Used equipment that is depreciable property may generally be included in Class 43.1 or 43.2, if it:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-was included in Class 43.1 or 43.2, respectively, by the vendor;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-remains at the same location at which it was used by the vendor; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-has been acquired by the taxpayer not more than five years from the time it became available for use to the vendor as determined pursuant to subsections 13(26) to (31).</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.14 The testing and commissioning of otherwise new equipment prior to the purchaser taking possession will not normally result in a finding that the property was used prior to its acquisition. However, a property will be considered to have been used where the vendor has used it regularly for demonstration purposes.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.15 An eligible property must satisfy all the conditions for inclusion in Class 43.1 or 43.2 on an annual basis. There is a limited exception in subsection 1104(14) of the Regulations for a property that is part of an eligible system that was previously operated in a qualifying manner. Such property is considered to be operated in the required manner during a period of deficiency, failure or shutdown of the system that is beyond the taxpayer’s control if the taxpayer makes all reasonable efforts to rectify the problem within a reasonable time. Under subsection 1104(15), this exception also applies where another person or partnership owns property that provides a steam host which is necessary for the taxpayer’s system to operate in the manner required by Class 43.1 or 43.2.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.16 If the exception does not apply and the property no longer qualifies for Class 43.1 or 43.2, pursuant to subsection 13(5), the UCC of the property will be transferred from Class 43.1 or 43.2 to the other class in which it is described as of the beginning of the particular tax year. Similarly, if in a following year, the property satisfies the annual requirements for inclusion in Class 43.1 or 43.2, the property will be reclassified into Class 43.1 or 43.2 as of the beginning of the tax year.

However, the definition excludes properties used primarily for certain income earning purposes, in particular:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a property acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada (other than the business of selling the energy generated from the property),</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a property that is acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from another property situated in Canada; or</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a property that is leased by (i) a corporation whose principal business is the renting or leasing of properties described in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iii) of the Regulations or (ii) a partnership that meets the conditions in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iv) and that is leased to:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a person who can reasonably be expected to use the property primarily for the purpose of earning income from business or property as described in ¶2.19(a) or (b); or</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a corporation or partnership that meets the principal business test described in ¶2.21 or a partnership that meets the conditions in paragraph 1100(26)(b).</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.20 According to subsection 1100(24), if a property is a specified energy property, CCA cannot be deducted to the extent that it would create or increase a loss from all such properties owned by the taxpayer. Essentially, the amount of CCA that may be claimed on a specified energy property is limited to the income earned from specified energy property and certain other similar energy conservation properties and thus, the CCA deduction cannot be used to shelter the taxpayer’s other sources of income.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.21 The specified energy property rules do not apply to corporations (or a partnership that meets the prescribed conditions in paragraph 1100(26)(b)) whose principal business (the principal business test) throughout the year is:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-manufacturing or processing;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-mining operations; or</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-the sale, distribution or production of electricity, natural gas, oil, steam, heat or any other form of energy or potential energy.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Example 1</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-The following illustrates how the specified energy property rules will apply in certain situations:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a wind turbine that generates electricity that is consumed in its business. The wind turbine meets the requirements of subparagraph (d)(v) of Class 43.1. The amount of electricity consumed in the taxpayer’s income earning activities exceeds 50% of the electricity generated by the wind turbine. Here, because the wind turbine is used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada the Class 43.2 property is not a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a Class 43.2 property that generates electricity which is partly used in its business. The amount of electricity consumed in carrying on the taxpayer’s income earning activities is 25% of the electricity generated by the Class 43.2 property. Because the Class 43.2 property is not used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada it is a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are limited in accordance with the specified energy property rules.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-A corporation whose principal business throughout the year is manufacturing acquires solar photovoltaic equipment. The corporation enters into an agreement with the provincial power authority to sell all of the electricity generated from the equipment. The equipment meets the requirements of subparagraph (d)(vi) of Class 43.1. Because the taxpayer meets the principal business test described in ¶2.21, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-  Example 2</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-This example illustrates the application of the specified energy property rules to a homeowner who owns a solar panel and sells the electricity generated from it to the provincial power authority. Since the taxpayer does not use the solar panel for the income earning purpose described in ¶2.19 , the solar panel is a specified energy property.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Application of the specified energy property rules</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Description UCC pool value Income</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Taxpayer’s UCC opening balance for the tax year $75 n/a</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Taxpayer’s income for the tax year (excluding the income from the solar panels included in Class 43.2) n/a $100</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Net income from solar panels included in Class 43.2 n/a $30</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Taxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax year n/a $130</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Deduction of limited CCA because of the application of the specified energy property rules ($30) ($30)</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Taxpayer’s UCC balance and income for the tax year after claiming limited CCA $45 $100</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Accelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCA</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.21.1 Under the first-year enhanced CCA, a taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct the capital cost of eligible Class 43.1 or 43.2 property in the first year the property becomes available for use by the taxpayer. This measure applies to property acquired after November 20, 2018. As reflected in the table below, it will be gradually phased out starting in 2024 and will no longer be in effect for properties that become available for use after 2027. For general information relating to measures adopted as part of the 2018 Fall Economic Statement, refer to the web page Accelerated Investment Incentive.

A property might be an accelerated investment property described in Class 43.1 or 43.2 and also be a specified energy property within the meaning of subsection 1100(25) of the Regulations. In such a case, the CCA deduction for the tax year will be limited as described in ¶2.20 and in Examples 1 and 2.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-General positions</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Purpose test</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.22 As a general rule most properties described in Class 43.1 must be used by the taxpayer, or the lessee of the taxpayer, primarily for the particular purpose of generating, collecting, storing or conserving energy, including the production of bio-oil, biogas and producer gas (the Purpose Test).</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.23 However, for certain properties, the Purpose Test can be met by someone other than the owner or the lessee of the equipment. For example:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-A taxpayer owns heat recovery equipment that extracts thermal waste generated directly in an industrial process, other than a process that generates electricity. The taxpayer enters into a contract with an arm’s length customer for the sale of the thermal waste and as a result the customer does not have to acquire energy. The Purpose Test described in subparagraph (d)(iv) of Class 43.1 will be met.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-A taxpayer owns equipment and uses it in a system that converts wood waste or plant residue into bio-oil. The bio-oil is then sold to an arm’s length customer who uses it primarily for the purpose of generating heat used directly in an industrial process. The Purpose Test described in subparagraph (d)(xi) of Class 43.1 will be met.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.24 The term industrial process as used in paragraph (d) of Class 43.1 generally means an operation in which goods are manufactured or processed.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Eligible and ineligible properties for Classes 43.1 and 43.2</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.25 Detailed information on eligible and ineligible properties is available in the Technical Guide to Class 43.1 and 43.2 on the NRCan web page entitled Tax Savings for Industry.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.26 Generally, a building or part of a building is specifically excluded from the description of eligible property in Class 43.1. However, there are some exceptions, for example:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a solar collector that is not a window and that is integrated into a building is eligible property under subparagraph (d)(i) of Class 43.1;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-an electrical generating plant, including a powerhouse, is eligible property under subparagraph (d)(ii) of Class 43.1;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-a solar cell or module that is integrated into a building is eligible property under subparagraph (d)(vi) of Class 43.1.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.27 Transmission equipment is usually specifically excluded from the description of eligible property in Class 43.1. However, transmission equipment is eligible for inclusion for properties described in the following subparagraphs of Class 43.1: (d)(ii) small-scale hydro-electric installation, (d)(v) wind energy conversion system, (d)(vi) fixed location photovoltaic equipment, (d)(vii) equipment for generating electrical energy, heat energy or both, solely from geothermal energy, and (d)(xiv) property using water-current, tidal or wave energy.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.28 The determination of whether equipment is electrical generating equipment or transmission equipment, which is defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations, is generally based on whether the electricity is ready to be put on transmission lines. A generating system typically ends at the point where the electricity is ready for use.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.29 CRCE includes certain intangible expenditures incurred in respect of the development of a project for which it is reasonable to expect that at least 50% of the capital cost of depreciable property to be used in the project would qualify for inclusion in Class 43.1 or 43.2.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.30 In order to qualify as CRCE, the expenditures must:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-be payable to a person or partnership with whom the taxpayer is dealing at arm's length; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-not be specifically excluded from CRCE under subsection 1219(2) of the Regulations.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.31 The term project is interpreted to include activities carried out to identify the objectives of the project, designing the process for achieving such objectives and completing the planned undertaking.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.32 Examples of the types of expenditures that qualify as CRCE include the cost of certain pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, environmental assessment expenditures, the cost of socio-economic studies, and expenditures for negotiating power purchase agreements. For more information on the type of expenditures that qualify as CRCE, refer to the NRCan Technical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.33 Expenditures on a project that is subsequently abandoned may still qualify as CRCE if at the time the expenditures were incurred, it was reasonable to expect that at least 50% of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the proposed project would qualify for inclusion in Class 43.1 or 43.2.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.34 Office expenses, management expenses, accounting expenses, marketing expenses and most business travelling expenses do not qualify as CRCE because they are incurred in respect of the management or administration of the business.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.35 Different types of security payments made in relation to a qualifying project (for example, payments to guarantee the completion and performance of the project or for network upgrades) required by some provincial authorities do not qualify as CRCE. Also, any costs incurred with respect to the posting of the guarantee represent financing costs, which do not qualify as CRCE.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.36 Expenditures to acquire an intellectual property or to develop a patent are generally included in the capital cost of depreciable property described in Class 14. However, if Class 14 does not apply, the expenditures may qualify for inclusion in Class 14.1.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.37 Expenditures incurred to develop new technologies for renewable energy equipment do not qualify as CRCE. These activities may benefit from the incentives relating to scientific research and experimental development.

However, expenditures for a test wind turbine that is part of a wind farm project and that meets the requirements set out in subsection 1219(3) of the Regulations will qualify as CRCE.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.39 In order for a wind turbine to qualify as a test wind turbine, the taxpayer must obtain a joint determination from the CRA and NRCan with respect to the legislative requirements in subsection 1219(3) of the Regulations. For more information, refer to the NRCan Technical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.40 Generally, a test wind turbine must:</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-otherwise meet the requirements of a wind energy conversion system under subparagraph (d)(v) of Class 43.1;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-be installed at the site of a planned wind farm project;</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-meet certain spacing and capacity requirements; and</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-test the level of electrical energy production from wind prior to the construction of the wind farm project.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.41 There can be more than one test wind turbine for each wind farm project.</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-General overview – deductions</span><br><span style='color: red;'>-2.42 Expenditures incurred by a taxpayer that qualify as CRCE are CEE and are reported on the Form T2Sch12.

Therefore, after the acquisition of control, successored CCEE will become unusable. To address this issue, the taxpayer is entitled to claim the maximum available CEE in the tax year that ends immediately before the acquisition of control according to subsection 66.1(3). This may create a non-capital loss that could be deducted in future tax years subject to certain restrictions.

The new measures were part ofBill C-19which became law onJune 23, 2022. This Folio will be updated to reflect the new measures.The new tax measures include:Classes 43.1 and 43.2 are expanded to include additional eligible properties such as equipment used to produce solid and liquid fuels from specified waste material or carbon dioxide; a broader range of equipment used for the production of hydrogen by electrolysis of water; and equipment used to dispense hydrogen for use inhydrogen-poweredautomotive equipment and vehicles. For a full list of eligible properties, refer tosection44ofBill C-19(S.C. 2022, c. 10).In addition, certain eligible properties powered fully or partially by fossil fuels are no longer eligible or have to meet new conditions.The expansion ofClasses 43.1and 43.2applies in respect of property that is acquired and that becomes available for use on or afterApril 19, 2021, where it has not been used or acquired for use before that day. The removal of certain property from eligibility forClasses 43.1and 43.2, as well as the application of the new conditions to equipment which uses fossil fuels, apply in respect of property that becomes available for useafter 2024.For tax years which beginafter 2021, a temporary measure to reduce the federal corporate income tax rates for qualifyingzero-emissiontechnology manufacturersfrom 15%to 7.5%(for income otherwise taxed at the general corporate rate) orfrom 9%to 4.5%(for income otherwise taxed at the small business rate) is adopted.Federal Budget 2022 announced that the Department of Finance Canada will engage with experts to establish an investment tax credit of upto 30%, focused onnet-zerotechnologies, battery storage solutions, and clean hydrogen. In addition, the eligibility underClasses 43.1and 43.2will be expanded to includeair-sourceheat pumps primarily used for space or water heating.SummaryThe Income Tax Act and Income Tax Regulations include the following measures to encourage Canadian taxpayers to make investments in qualifying clean energy generation and energy conservation projects:an accelerated capital cost allowance (CCA) for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment;a first-year enhanced CCA for investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment which allows a taxpayer to fully deduct the capital cost of eligible properties in the first year they are available for use by the taxpayer;Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE), which is a category of expenditures relating to the development of eligible clean energy generation and energy conservation projects that may be deducted in full in the year incurred, carried forward indefinitely for use in futuretax yearsor renounced under aflow-throughshare agreement; andAtlantic investment tax creditof 10%of the cost of prescribed energy generation and conservation properties.The purpose of this Chapter is to describe these incentives and the criteria necessary to benefit from them.Responsibility for administering the tax incentives is shared between the CRA and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). According tosubsection 13(18.1), theTechnical Guide toClass 43.1and 43.2, which is published by NRCan, applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters that arise when determining whether a property qualifies for accelerated CCA. The guide provides technical information on eligible properties that meet the requirements of the particular paragraph or subparagraph ofClass 43.1, ineligible properties that are specifically excluded fromClass 43.1, tables of typical capital costs for the different technologies and the relevant forms necessary to obtain a technical opinion from NRCan on the scientific and engineering requirements. This guide is available on the NRCan web page entitledTax Savings for Industry.For the purposes of the definition of CRCE insubsection 66.1(6), theTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE)published by NRCan applies conclusively with respect to engineering and scientific matters. This guide is also available on the NRCan web page entitled Tax Savings for Industry.The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) issues income tax folios to provide a summary of technical interpretations and positions regarding certain provisions contained in income tax law. Due to their technical nature, folios are used primarily by tax specialists and other individuals who have an interest in tax matters. While each paragraph in a chapter of a folio may relate to provisions of the law in force at the time it was written (see theApplicationsection), the information provided is not a substitute for the law. The reader should, therefore, consider the chapter’s information in light of the relevant provisions of the law in force for the particular tax year being considered.The CRA may have published additional guidance and detailed filing instructions on matters discussed in this Chapter and other topics that may be of interest. See the CRA’sForms and publicationsweb page for this and other topics that may be of interest.Table of contentsDiscussion and interpretationAbbreviations and definitions usedAccelerated CCAGeneral rulesProperty eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.2Specified energy property rulesAccelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCAGeneral positionsCanadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)Geothermal energyTest wind turbinesGeneral overview – deductionsFlow-through shares – subsection 66(15)Principal-business corporation defined in subsection 66(15)Flow-through sharesAtlantic investment tax creditTable of eligible propertiesApplicationReferenceHistoryDiscussion and interpretationAbbreviations and definitions used2.1The following abbreviations are used in this Chapter and have the meaning contained in the Act:CCA– capital cost allowance;CCEE– cumulative Canadian exploration expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6);CEE– Canadian exploration expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6);CEE(CRCE)– Canadian renewable and conservation expense included inparagraph (g.1)of the definition of CEE insubsection 66.1(6);CRCE– Canadian renewable and conservation expense as defined insubsection 66.1(6)andsubsection 1219(1)of the Regulations;FTS– flow-through share as defined in subsection 66(15).

For more information refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F8-C1,Principal-businessCorporations in the Resource Industries; andUCC– undepreciated capital cost as defined insubsection 13(21).2.2The termprimarilyis usually considered to be a threshold of more than50%. In establishing whether a particular property is used primarily for the purpose of a given activity, different factors are examined such as the proportion of time that it is used in this activity or the relative proportions of the output that is generated from the property. In addition to this quantitative test, the circumstances may require a qualitative assessment of the taxpayer’s main purpose in using the property.2.3Generally, the phraseall or substantially allmeans at least90%.Accelerated CCA2.4A taxpayer may claim CCA only on property described inSchedule IIof the Regulations that was acquired for the purpose of earning income. For general information relating to CCA, refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowanceand the CRA web pageClaiming capital cost allowance (CCA).2.4.1The Government of Canada's 2018 Fall Economic Statement introduced theAccelerated Investment Incentivewhich creates an enhanced CCA for certain eligible properties (referred to asfirst-yearenhanced CCA). A taxpayer can claim it only for the year in which the eligible property first becomes available for use. Generally, property described inClass 43.1or 43.2which is acquired afterNovember 20, 2018and put into usebefore 2028will meet the definition ofaccelerated investment propertyinsubsection 1104(4)of the Regulations. Such property will be eligible for thefirst-yearenhanced CCA if all other requirements are met.General rules2.5Clean energy generation and energy conservation technologies are a key component of the Government’s approach to promoting sustainable economic growth and can contribute to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. One way to promote these technologies is to allow a business to reduce its taxable income in the early years of an asset’s operation by claiming CCA at a high rate. This accelerated CCA is an exception to the general practice of setting CCA rates based on the useful life of an asset.2.6Class 43.1 and Class 43.2 ofSchedule IIof the Regulations provide accelerated CCA rates for qualifying investments in clean energy generation and energy conservation equipment situated in Canada.Class 43.1is the permanent class and hasa 30%CCA rate on a declining balance basis. This Class includes a detailed description of the different types of eligible properties.2.7Class 43.2 has a 50% CCA rate on a declining balance basis. Most of the equipment that is described inClass 43.1will qualify forthe 50%CCA rate underClass 43.2when the property is acquiredbefore 2025. However, the following equipment only qualifies forthe 30%CCA rate inClass 43.1:mid-efficiency, fully or partiallyfossil-fuelledcogeneration systems;electric vehicle charging stations set up to supply more than10 kWbut less than90 kWof continuous power; andelectrical energy storage equipment connected to one of the above systems andstand-aloneelectrical energy storage systems meeting particular efficiency requirements.2.8Where a depreciable property qualifies for Class 43.1or 43.2, it cannot be included in another class even though the property may otherwise meet the requirements of that other class.2.9Class 43.1 deals with the following two broad categories of equipment as listed in theTable of eligible properties:equipment described in paragraphs (a)to (c)ofClass 43.1; andequipment described in any of the subparagraphs ofparagraph (d)ofClass 43.1.2.10Eligible input sources for equipment included in Class 43.1or 43.2are:renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal, wave or tidal energy;eligible waste fuels defined in subsection 1104(13) of the Regulations such as biogas,bio-oil, digester gas, landfill gas, municipal waste, plant residue, pulp and paper waste, and wood waste or producer gas and in some cases spent pulping liquor; andfossil fuels (other than solution gas) where the designated heat rate is satisfied and in certain other situations described insubparagraph (d)(ix)ofClass 43.1.Property eligible for Class 43.1 or 43.22.11The depreciable property must:be situated in Canada;be acquired by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada or from property situated in Canada, or the property must be acquired by a taxpayer in order to be leased to a lessee who will use the property for the same income earning purpose; andsubject to certain exceptions, not have been used for any purpose before the taxpayer acquired the property.2.12Reconditioned and remanufactured equipment is excluded fromClass 43.1or 43.2even if the reconditioning makes the equipment more energy efficient by current standards.2.13Used equipment that is depreciable property may generally be included inClass 43.1or 43.2, if it:was included in Class 43.1 or 43.2, respectively, by the vendor;remains at the same location at which it was used by the vendor; andhas been acquired by the taxpayer not more than five years from the time it became available for use to the vendor as determined pursuant tosubsections 13(26)to (31).2.14The testing and commissioning of otherwise new equipment prior to the purchaser taking possession will not normally result in a finding that the property was used prior to its acquisition. However, a property will be considered to have been used where the vendor has used it regularly for demonstration purposes.2.15An eligible property must satisfy all the conditions for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2on an annual basis. There is a limited exception insubsection 1104(14)of the Regulations for a property that is part of an eligible system that was previously operated in a qualifying manner. Such property is considered to be operated in the required manner during a period of deficiency, failure or shutdown of the system that is beyond the taxpayer’s control if the taxpayer makes all reasonable efforts to rectify the problem within a reasonable time. Undersubsection 1104(15), this exception also applies where another person or partnership owns property that provides a steam host which is necessary for the taxpayer’s system to operate in the manner required byClass 43.1or 43.2.2.16If the exception does not apply and the property no longer qualifies forClass 43.1or 43.2, pursuant tosubsection 13(5), the UCC of the property will be transferred fromClass 43.1or 43.2to the other class in which it is described as of the beginning of the particulartax year. Similarly, if in a following year, the property satisfies the annual requirements for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2, the property will be reclassified intoClass 43.1or 43.2as of the beginning of thetax year. For more information, refer to¶1.123to 1.131ofIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1,General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.2.17Properties described insubparagraphs (c)(i), (d)(vii),(d)(viii),(d)(ix),(d)(xi),(d)(xiii),(d)(xiv),(d)(xvi)andsubparagraph (d)(xvii)ofClass 43.1andparagraph (a)ofClass 43.2may be included inClass 43.1or 43.2only if they are in compliance with environmental laws,by-lawsand regulations at the time the property first becomes available for use.Specified energy property rules2.18In general, the specified energy property rules limit the amount of CCA that passive investors may deduct to the amount of income from such property.2.19Specified energy property within the meaning ofsubsection 1100(25)of the Regulations generally means property included inClass 43.1or 43.2. However, the definition excludes properties used primarily for certain income earning purposes, in particular:a property acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from a business carried on in Canada (other than the business of selling the energy generated from the property),a property that is acquired to be used by the owner primarily for the purpose of earning income from another property situated in Canada; ora property that is leased by (i) a corporation whose principal business is the renting or leasing of properties described in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iii) of the Regulations or (ii) a partnership that meets the conditions in subparagraph 1100(25)(b)(iv) and that is leased to:a person who can reasonably be expected to use the property primarily for the purpose of earning income from business or property as described in ¶2.19(a) or (b); ora corporation or partnership that meets the principal business test described in ¶2.21 or a partnership that meets the conditions in paragraph 1100(26)(b).2.20According to subsection 1100(24), if a property is a specified energy property, CCA cannot be deducted to the extent that it would create or increase a loss from all such properties owned by the taxpayer. Essentially, the amount of CCA that may be claimed on a specified energy property is limited to the income earned from specified energy property and certain other similar energy conservation properties and thus, the CCA deduction cannot be used to shelter the taxpayer’s other sources of income.2.21The specified energy property rules do not apply to corporations (or a partnership that meets the prescribed conditions inparagraph 1100(26)(b))whose principal business (theprincipal business test) throughout the year is:manufacturing or processing;mining operations; orthe sale, distribution or production of electricity, natural gas, oil, steam, heat or any other form of energy or potential energy.Example 1The following illustrates how the specified energy property rules will apply in certain situations:A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires a wind turbine that generates electricity that is consumed in its business. The wind turbine meets the requirements ofsubparagraph (d)(v)ofClass 43.1. The amount of electricity consumed in the taxpayer’s income earning activities exceeds50%of the electricity generated by the wind turbine. Here, because the wind turbine is used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada theClass 43.2property is not a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.A taxpayer carries on a business and acquires aClass 43.2property that generates electricity which is partly used in its business. The amount of electricity consumed in carrying on the taxpayer’s income earning activities is25%of the electricity generated by theClass 43.2property. Because theClass 43.2property is not used primarily for the purpose of earning income from business carried on in Canada it is a specified energy property. Therefore, CCA deductions are limited in accordance with the specified energy property rules.A corporation whose principal business throughout the year is manufacturing acquires solar photovoltaic equipment. The corporation enters into an agreement with the provincial power authority to sell all of the electricity generated from the equipment. The equipment meets the requirements ofsubparagraph (d)(vi)ofClass 43.1. Because the taxpayer meets the principal business test described in¶2.21, CCA deductions are not limited under the specified energy property rules.Example 2This example illustrates the application of the specified energy property rules to a homeowner who owns a solar panel and sells the electricity generated from it to the provincial power authority. Since the taxpayer does not use the solar panel for the income earning purpose described in¶2.19, the solar panel is a specified energy property.Application of the specified energy property rulesDescriptionUCC pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s UCC opening balance for the tax year$75n/aTaxpayer’s income for the tax year (excluding the income from the solar panels included inClass 43.2)n/a$100Net income from solar panels included in Class 43.2n/a$30Taxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$130Deduction of limited CCA because of the application of the specified energy property rules($30)($30)Taxpayer’s UCC balance and income for the tax year after claiming limited CCA$45$100Accelerated Investment Incentive – First-year enhanced CCA2.21.1Under the first-year enhanced CCA, a taxpayer is entitled to fully deduct the capital cost of eligibleClass 43.1or 43.2property in the first year the property becomes available for use by the taxpayer. This measure applies to property acquired afterNovember 20, 2018. As reflected in the table below, it will be gradually phased out startingin 2024and will no longer be in effect for properties that become available for useafter 2027.For general information relating to measures adopted as part ofthe 2018Fall Economic Statement, refer to the web pageAccelerated Investment Incentive.

For more information relating to CCA, refer toIncome TaxFolio S3-F4-C1,General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance, as well as the web pagesClaiming capital cost allowance (CCA)and theAccelerated Investment Incentive.2.21.3The availability of the first-year enhanced CCA does not override the application of the specified energy property rules describedin ¶2.18to 2.21. A property might be an accelerated investment property described inClass 43.1or 43.2and also be a specified energy property within the meaning ofsubsection 1100(25)of the Regulations. In such a case, the CCA deduction for the tax year will be limited as describedin ¶2.20and inExamples 1and 2.General positionsPurpose test2.22As a general rule most properties described inClass 43.1must be used by the taxpayer, or the lessee of the taxpayer, primarily for the particular purpose of generating, collecting, storing or conserving energy, including the production ofbio-oil, biogas and producer gas (thePurpose Test).2.23However, for certain properties, the Purpose Test can be met by someone other than the owner or the lessee of the equipment. For example:A taxpayer owns heat recovery equipment that extracts thermal waste generated directly in an industrial process, other than a process that generates electricity. The taxpayer enters into a contract with an arm’s length customer for the sale of the thermal waste and as a result the customer does not have to acquire energy. The Purpose Test described insubparagraph (d)(iv)ofClass 43.1will be met.A taxpayer owns equipment and uses it in a system that converts wood waste or plant residue intobio-oil. Thebio-oilis then sold to an arm’s length customer who uses it primarily for the purpose of generating heat used directly in an industrial process. The Purpose Test described insubparagraph (d)(xi)ofClass 43.1will be met.2.24The termindustrial processas used inparagraph (d)ofClass 43.1generally means an operation in which goods are manufactured or processed.Eligible and ineligible properties for Classes 43.1 and 43.22.25Detailed information on eligible and ineligible properties is available in the Technical Guide toClass 43.1and 43.2on the NRCan web page entitledTax Savings for Industry.2.26Generally, a building or part of a building is specifically excluded from the description of eligible property inClass 43.1. However, there are some exceptions, for example:a solar collector that is not a window and that is integrated into a building is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(i)ofClass 43.1;an electrical generating plant, including a powerhouse, is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(ii)ofClass 43.1;a solar cell or module that is integrated into a building is eligible property undersubparagraph (d)(vi)ofClass 43.1.2.27Transmission equipment is usually specifically excluded from the description of eligible property inClass 43.1. However, transmission equipment is eligible for inclusion for properties described in the following subparagraphs ofClass 43.1:(d)(ii)small-scalehydro-electricinstallation,(d)(v)wind energy conversion system,(d)(vi) fixedlocation photovoltaic equipment, (d)(vii) equipment for generating electrical energy, heat energy or both, solely from geothermal energy, and(d)(xiv)property usingwater-current, tidal or wave energy.2.28The determination of whether equipment is electrical generating equipment or transmission equipment, which is defined insubsection 1104(13)of the Regulations, is generally based on whether the electricity is ready to be put on transmission lines. A generating system typically ends at the point where the electricity is ready for use.Canadian renewable and conservation expense (CRCE)2.29CRCE includes certain intangible expenditures incurred in respect of the development of a project for which it is reasonable to expect that at least50%of the capital cost of depreciable property to be used in the project would qualify for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2.2.30In order to qualify as CRCE, the expenditures must:be payable to a person or partnership with whom the taxpayer is dealing at arm's length; andnot be specifically excluded from CRCE undersubsection 1219(2)of the Regulations.2.31The termprojectis interpreted to include activities carried out to identify the objectives of the project, designing the process for achieving such objectives and completing the planned undertaking.2.32Examples of the types of expenditures that qualify as CRCE include the cost of certainpre-feasibilityand feasibility studies, environmental assessment expenditures, the cost ofsocio-economicstudies, and expenditures for negotiating power purchase agreements. For more information on the type of expenditures that qualify as CRCE, refer to the NRCanTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).2.33Expenditures on a project that is subsequently abandoned may still qualify as CRCE if at the time the expenditures were incurred, it was reasonable to expect that at least50%of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the proposed project would qualify for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2.2.34Office expenses, management expenses, accounting expenses, marketing expenses and most business travelling expenses do not qualify as CRCE because they are incurred in respect of the management or administration of the business.2.35Different types of security payments made in relation to a qualifying project (for example, payments to guarantee the completion and performance of the project or for network upgrades) required by some provincial authorities do not qualify as CRCE. Also, any costs incurred with respect to the posting of the guarantee represent financing costs, which do not qualify as CRCE.2.36Expenditures to acquire an intellectual property or to develop a patent are generally included in the capital cost of depreciable property described inClass 14. However, ifClass 14does not apply, the expenditures may qualify for inclusion inClass 14.1.2.37Expenditures incurred to develop new technologies for renewable energy equipment do not qualify as CRCE. These activities may benefit from the incentives relating to scientific research and experimental development. For more information, refer to the CRA web pageScientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentive Program.Geothermal energy2.37.1In addition to the general rules describedin ¶2.29to 2.37, for a project for which it is reasonable to expect that atleast 50%of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in the project would be the capital cost of any property that is described insubparagraph (d)(vii)ofClass 43.1(which is equipment used primarily to generate electrical energy, heat energy, or both, solely from geothermal energy), the following expenses may also qualify as CRCE, provided that they are incurred afterMarch 21, 2017:the cost of drilling geothermal wells; andexpenses incurred solely to determine the extent and quality of a geothermal resource, such as for example, the cost of completing an exploratory well.2.37.2However, the cost of completing either (i) a production well or (ii) an exploratory well that is used for production (including small-scale heat or electricity production) will not qualify as CRCE but may form part of the cost of depreciable property and may be eligible for an inclusion in Class 43.2 of the Regulations.2.37.3CRCE treatment will be available for expenses in geothermal projects only if, in the year incurred, such expenses meet the requirements of all applicable environmental laws, by-laws and regulations.Test wind turbines2.38Usually, expenditures incurred for the acquisition and installation of depreciable property do not qualify as CRCE. However, expenditures for a test wind turbine that is part of a wind farm project and that meets the requirements set out insubsection 1219(3)of the Regulations will qualify as CRCE.2.39In order for a wind turbine to qualify as a test wind turbine, the taxpayer must obtain a joint determination from the CRA and NRCan with respect to the legislative requirements insubsection 1219(3)of the Regulations. For more information, refer to the NRCanTechnical Guide to Canadian Renewable and Conservation Expenses (CRCE).2.40Generally, a test wind turbine must:otherwise meet the requirements of a wind energy conversion system undersubparagraph (d)(v)ofClass 43.1;be installed at the site of a planned wind farm project;meet certain spacing and capacity requirements; andtest the level of electrical energy production from wind prior to the construction of the wind farm project.2.41There can be more than one test wind turbine for each wind farm project.General overview – deductions2.42Expenditures incurred by a taxpayer that qualify as CRCE are CEE and are reported on theForm T2Sch12. These expenditures are added to the taxpayer’s CCEE pool and may be deducted by the taxpayer in thetax yearthat they are incurred or carried forward indefinitely for deduction in futuretax years.Example 3Application of the annual CEE deduction to compute a taxpayer’s income for atax yearDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Feasibility study expenses that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$70n/aMaximum CEE deduction for the tax year($70)($70)Taxpayer’s CCEE balance and income for the tax year$0$302.43Any consideration received by a taxpayer for property or services, the cost of which was CRCE, will be deducted from the taxpayer’s CCEE pool undersubsection 66(12.1). For example, if the taxpayer has disposed of feasibility studies, the cost of which previously qualified asCEE(CRCE), the taxpayer will reduce its CCEE pool by the amount of the consideration received.Example 4Application of the annual CEE deduction to compute a taxpayer’s income for a year in the case of recovery of CEEDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer’s CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer’s income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Feasibility study expenditures that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$70n/aDisposition of feasibility study to an arm’s length purchaser for $30($30)n/aMaximum CEE deduction for the tax year($40)($40)Taxpayer’s CCEE balance and income for the tax year$0$60Partnerships2.44A partnership cannot deduct CRCE. Instead, the partner’s CEE(CRCE) will include its share of the partnership’s CEE (CRCE), if the taxpayer is a member of the partnership at the end of the partnership’s fiscal period. For more information on partnerships, refer toIncome Tax Folio S4-F16-C1, What is a Partnership?2.45A taxpayer who disposes of all of its interest in a partnership during the partnership fiscal period does not share in the partnership’sCEE(CRCE)for that fiscal period. Similarly, any portion ofCEE(CRCE)of the partnership that has been included in a partner’sCEE(CRCE)cannot be transferred to a third party who acquires the partnership interest.2.46The partner adds its share of the partnership’sCEE(CRCE)to its own CCEE pool.  Underclause 53(2)(c)(ii)(C), the adjusted cost base of the partner’s partnership interest is reduced to reflect the partner’s share of the partnership’sCEE(CRCE).Acquisition of control2.47Where a corporation is subject to an acquisition of control, the CCEE pool that exists immediately before the acquisition of control becomes subject to the successor rules insection 66.7(successored CCEE). After the acquisition of control, the successor corporation may deduct the successored CCEE only to the extent of production income from a Canadian resource property as defined insubsection 66(15)that is owned by the corporation immediately before the acquisition of control. For more information on Canadian resource properties refer toInterpretation Bulletin IT-125R4 (Archived) – Dispositions of Resource Propertiesand¶1.21ofIncome Tax Folio S3-F8-C1.2.48A taxpayer who is a PBC operating in clean energy generation and energy conservation industries may have CCEE but will likely not own Canadian resource property. Therefore, after the acquisition of control, successored CCEE will become unusable. To address this issue, the taxpayer is entitled to claim the maximum available CEE in thetax yearthat ends immediately before the acquisition of control according tosubsection 66.1(3). This may create anon-capitalloss that could be deducted in futuretax yearssubject to certain restrictions. For more information concerning the loss restriction rules, refer toInterpretation Bulletin IT-232R3, Losses - Their Deductibility in the Loss Year or in Other Years.Example 5Creation of anon-capitalloss prior to the acquisition of control where a taxpayer is a PBC operating in clean energy generation and energy conservation industries and it does not own a Canadian resource propertyDescriptionCCEE pool valueIncomeTaxpayer's CCEE opening balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer's income from all sources for the tax yearn/a$100Expenses incurred that qualify as CEE(CRCE)$150n/aMaximum CCEE deduction($150)($150)Taxpayer's CCEE balance for the tax year$0n/aTaxpayer's non-capital loss for a tax year subject to the loss restriction rulesn/a($50)Flow-through shares – subsection 66(15)2.49FTSs help corporations that are PBCs which operate in the clean energy generation and energy conservation industries to finance their development activities. A PBC may renounce expenditures that qualify as CRCE to its investors who subscribe for FTSs. The possibility of renouncing CRCE is of particular advantage to PBCs that are not currently taxable, as it allows the PBC to transfer the resource expenses to the investor. For more information, refer toIncome Tax Folio S3-F8-C1and the CRA web page,Flow-through shares (FTSs).Guide T100 – Instructions for the Flow-Through Share Programprovides information on reporting procedures regarding theflow-throughshare program.Principal-business corporation defined in subsection 66(15)2.50In the context of clean energy generation and energy conservation industries, a PBC includes a corporation the principal business of which is any of, or a combination of:the generation or distribution of energy, or the production of fuel using property described inClass 43.1or 43.2, andthe development of projects for which it is reasonable to expect that at least50%of the capital cost of the depreciable property to be used in each project would qualify for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2.2.51A PBC also includes a corporation, all or substantially all of the assets of which are shares or debt of another PBC that is related to the corporation otherwise than because of a right referred to inparagraph 251(5)(b). For more information on related persons, refer toIncome Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length.Flow-through shares2.52A share or a right is an FTS undersubsection 66(15)if:it is:a share issued by a PBC (other than aprescribed sharewhich is defined insubsections 6202.1(1)and (2)of the Regulations) ora right to acquire a share of the capital stock of a PBC (other than aprescribed rightwhich is defined insubsections 6202.1(1.1)and (2.1));it is issued pursuant to a written agreement with an investor under which the PBC agrees to incur CEE(CRCE) in an amount equal to the consideration received for the share or the right and renounce this amount in favour of the investor within a specific period of time; andit is issued for consideration that does not include property transferred by the investor on atax-deferredbasis.2.53If the risk of loss to the investor is limited or it may be reasonable to consider that there is an obligation to repay or return all or part of the original investment, these shares or rights are considered prescribed shares or prescribed rights, respectively, and are not FTSs. For more information refer to the CRA web pageFlow-through shares.Atlantic investment tax credit2.54TheAtlantic investment tax creditinsubsection 127(9)is a credit equal to10%of the capital cost of prescribed energy generation and conservation properties that are used primarily for the purpose of the following activities:manufacturing or processing goods for sale or lease;farming or fishing;logging;storing grain; orharvesting peatand the activities are carried on in the Atlantic provinces, the Gaspé Peninsula and their associated offshore regions.2.55The Atlantic investment tax credit applies to the following qualified properties which are defined insubsection 127(9):prescribed energy generation and conservation property which includes all the properties described inClass 43.1and 43.2acquired by the taxpayerafter March 28, 2012; andprescribed energy generation and conservation properties that are leased in the ordinary course of carrying on business in Canada by a corporation:whose principal business is leasing property, lending money, purchasing conditional sales contracts and account receivables;who manufactured and leased the property and the lessor’s principal business is manufacturing the property it sells or leases; orwhose principal business is selling or servicing properties described inClasses 43.1or 43.2.2.56Where a prescribed energy generation and conservation property is leased, the lessee must use the leased qualified property in the activities described in¶2.54.Table of eligible propertiesProperties eligible for inclusion inClass 43.1or 43.2Qualifying propertyIncome Tax Regulation referenceTechnical Guide toClass 43.1and 43.2referenceCogeneration and specified-waste fuelled electrical generation systemsParagraphs (a) to (c) ofClass 43.1andparagraph (a)and (b)ofClass 43.2Section 2.1Thermal waste electrical generation equipmentParagraphs (a) and (b), andsubparagraph (c)(iii)ofClass 43.1Section 2.2Active solar heating equipment andground-sourceheat pump systemsClause (d)(i)(A)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.3Small-scalehydro-electricinstallationsSubparagraphs (d)(ii) to (d)(iii.1) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.4Heat recovery equipmentSubparagraphs (a)(iii) and paragraph (b); andsubparagraph (d)(iv)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.5Wind energy conversion systemsSubparagraphs (d)(v) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.6Photovoltaic electrical generation equipmentSubparagraphs (d)(vi) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.7Geothermal energy equipmentSubparagraphs (d)(vii) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.8Landfill gas and digester gas collection equipmentSubparagraphs (d)(viii) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.9Specified-waste fuelled heat production equipmentSubparagraphs (d)(ix) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.10Expansion engine systemsSubparagraphs (d)(x) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.11Systems to convert biomass into bio-oilSubparagraphs (d)(xi) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.12Fixed location fuel cell equipmentSubparagraphs (a)(ii.1)paragraph (b),andsubparagraph (d)(xii)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.13Systems to produce biogas by anaerobic digestionSubparagraphs (d)(xiii)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.14Water-current, tidal or wave energy equipmentSubparagraphs (d)(xiv) andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.15District energy systems/equipmentSubparagraphs (a)(iii.1)andparagraph (b),and (d)(xv)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1Section 2.16Producer gas generating equipment (acquired afterFebruary 11, 2014)Subparagraphs (d)(xvi)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1TBDElectric vehicle charging equipment (acquired afterMarch 21, 2016)Subparagraph (d)(xvii)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1andsubparagraph (b)(ii)ofClass 43.2TBDElectrical energy storage equipment (acquired afterMarch 21, 2016)Subparagraph (d)(xviii)andparagraph (e)ofClass 43.1andsubparagraph (b)(iii)ofClass 43.2TBDApplicationThis updated Chapter, which may be referenced asS3-F8-C2, is effective as ofAugust 2, 2019.This Chapter was first published on April 20, 2017.
