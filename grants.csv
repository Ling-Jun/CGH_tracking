Please contactNRC.Arctic_Northern-Arctique_Nord.CNRC@nrc-cnrc.gc.caif you wish to receive the overview document in any of the languages listed.CreeInuinnaqtunInuktitutInuvialuktunMichifTlichoAreas of focusWorking with Canadian and international partners from Northern communities, academia, industry, government and other interested stakeholders, research conducted under the program will examine 4 research themes and 2 cross-cutting areas, as outlined in theprogram plan.Research themesHousingConduct applied research and/or develop technologies to improve the adequacy, suitability and affordability of Northern homes.HealthConduct applied research and/or develop technologies to improve the accessibility, comprehensiveness and appropriateness of Northern health resources.FoodConduct applied research and/or develop technologies to improve the accessibility, availability and quality of Northern food resources.WaterConduct applied research and/or develop technologies to improve the availability, accessibility and quality of Northern water resources.Cross-cutting areasCapacity buildingProjects will demonstrate how they will aim to increase Northern and Indigenous R&D capacity (individual, organizational and community), to solve pressing issues confronting Northerners.Indigenous KnowledgeProjects will show how they will braid Indigenous Knowledge with the study design, data collection, project implementation, training and/or technology advancement, with at least one Indigenous Knowledge holder involved in the project.Projects funded by the Arctic and Northern Challenge programRead more about theprojectsthat were selected for the first call for proposals from the Arctic and Northern Challenge program in 2022.Arctic and Northern Challenge program consultation summariesFeedback from Northern peoples included advice on priority research areas, program mechanics and the importance of cross-cutting themes such as Indigenous Knowledge and capacity building. 4 research themes were identified:HousingHealthFoodWaterThis information was used to develop the program plan and is provided here to help inform applications to the program. More comprehensive reports on the consultations are available upon request.Getting involvedFor collaboratorsThere will be ongoing future opportunities for Indigenous collaborators to get involved. Researchers from Indigenous governments and organizations as well as the academic, public and not for profit and private sectors may express their interest in collaborating byemailing us. In the meantime, follow us on social media for updates using #NRCArcticNorthernProgram.Grant and contribution fundingwill be available through the NRC's National Program Office for eligible recipients collaborating on projects under the program. This may include contributions to collaborative R&D as well as equipment needed for research in fundamental areas. Consult thecollaborative R&D fundingpage for more information.The Canada-Inuit Nunangat-United Kingdom Arctic Research Programme (CINUK)The program's first call with its Inuit, United Kingdom and Canadian partners, calledCINUK, is complete, and13 projectshave been selected for funding.
