It supports high-growth* businesses that are seeking to improve productivity, scale-up and commercialize technology. It offers interest-free, repayable funding to incorporated businesses.* Definition of a “high-growth business”A high growth business can be defined as any for-profit company that has notable and/or consistent revenue increases year-over-year. Priority will normally be given to companies with 20% year-over-year revenue growth.Here are examples of a high-growth business:Example 1:ABC is an innovative Canadian medical devices firm. ABC is a relatively young company operating in North America and would like to expand its product into new markets like Europe and Asia. ABC has generated significant sales growth (such as 26% year-over-year). ABC has profitable reinvestment opportunities and, rather than paying dividends to shareholders, decides to reinvest earnings back into the firm to capitalize on its investment opportunities in order to maintain this high sales growth.Example 2:XYZ is an innovative Canadian digital software developer. XYZ is a young company operating in Canada and the USA but would like to introduce its new software, which is in the late stage of development, in order to grow and diversify existing Canadian and American markets. XYZ has generated significant sales growth (such as 22% year over year). XYZ has recently received a round of investments that will assist with its growth.On this pageEligibilityAvailable fundingEligible costsIneligible costsExpected outcomesFunding disbursementRepayment termsFunding decisionsApplication processHow to submit an expression of interestAfter submitting an expression of interestApplication reviewElements of a strong proposalContactsEligibilityTheBSPprogram is open to incorporated high-growth businesses that have been operating in the Prairie Provinces for a minimum of 2 years.

This fund will help companies and not-for-profit organizations advance and commercialize quantum products and solutions for domestic and global markets.The Regional Quantum Initiative advancesPrairiesCan’s strategic priorities. As one of four regional hubs of Canadian expertise in the field of quantum technologies, Alberta is well-positioned to transform research into products and processes. The Alberta region has strengths in quantum computing, materials, sensors and communications technology.Quantum science is the study, manipulation and control of systems at the atomic and subatomic level. It can lead to transformative technologies in fields such as computing, sensors, secure communications and advanced materials development.Quantum technology is at the leading edge of science and innovation, with enormous potential for commercialization. In addition to helping transform the Canadian economy, quantum technologies have the potential to help advance a wide range of benefits for Canadians, including:the design and delivery of new medicines, vaccines and next-generation batteries;more efficient and secure supply chains and digital communication;new greener products and new approaches to model, track and forecast climate change.Areas of focus forRQIinclude:quantum computing;quantum sensors;quantum communications technology;quantum materials.How and when to applyYou can submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) by contacting PrairiesCan at one of ourlocal offices in Alberta.EOIswill be accepted on a continuous intake basis until the funding is fully allocated.RQIfunding can be used for eligible initiatives until March 31, 2028.Eligible applicantsThis is a competitive program with priority given to eligible applicants in Alberta’s quantum hub that are:Incorporated businesses, including start-ups/early revenue firms that are commercializing or adopting quantum technologies or quantum-based solutions.  Preference may be given to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with less than 500 full-time employees (FTEs).Applicants must:be a for-profit company incorporated to conduct business in Canada;have staffed operating facilities in Alberta;have confirmed funding from all other sources, including government and non-government (non-government funds must represent at least 50% of the proposed project costs).Not-for-profit organizations, including those that support quantum businesses, innovators and entrepreneurs for start-up, growth, productivity, technology commercialization, technology adoption, export and investment attraction, including:post-secondary educational institutions;business accelerators and incubators;angel networks;Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) organizations, including Indigenous-led not-for profit organizations and Indigenous-owned businesses;groups of eligible recipients such as industry associations or consortiums.All eligible applicants must be legal entities capable of entering into legally binding agreements.Eligible activities could includeProductivity improvement, which includes:acquiring, adapting and adopting new technologies and processes;process re-engineering;improving manufacturing capacity.Business scale-up, which includes:developing or expanding markets;adopting best management practices, processes and systems;developing business opportunities.Technology commercialization, which includes:growing and diversifying markets through late stage product development;technology showcasing and demonstration (Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 7-9as defined by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada).Ecosystem capacity building, which includes:developing strategic business alliances within a specific sector or cluster;identifying barriers to scale-up and productivity enhancement within the sector or cluster through research and analysis;developing a strategy to address these barriers.Business acceleration and incubation, which includes:helping entrepreneurs create and grow their start-up companies by providing advice on how to:create a business plan;determine a marketing strategy;hire employees, experts and/or mentors;advance technology toTRL7-9;deploy specialized equipment.Priority underRQImay be given to projects that contribute to one or more of the following:clean economic growthby transitioning to greening of products or operations or environmentally sustainable practices;diversity, equity and inclusionthrough an increase in participation of underrepresented groups.Eligible project costsIncremental costs essential to the project.
