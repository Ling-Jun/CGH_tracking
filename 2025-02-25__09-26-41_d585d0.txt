The Initiative supports a cohort of participants, called Energy Champions, in their journey from training through to project planning and development. Energy Champions work closely with renewable energy leaders and their communities to plan and develop projects that reflect their community’s priorities.How the Initiative worksThe selected Energy Champions navigate through the phases of the Initiative (details about the phases are provided on theCohort 1andCohort 2webpages).
