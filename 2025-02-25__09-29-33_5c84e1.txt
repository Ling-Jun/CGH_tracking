Critical Minerals Geoscience and Data InitiativeBoosting Canada’s critical minerals potential through data and digital technologiesThe Critical Minerals Geoscience and Data (CMGD) Initiative is dedicated to unlocking the sustainable development of Canada’s critical minerals resources by providing essential knowledge and data to support informed decision-making. This will be achieved by funding initiatives to enhance access to important data and generating insights on the geological potential of new critical minerals sources in Canada.By harnessing the power of geoscience and data, we are paving the way for the responsible growth of industries reliant on these minerals, from technology and energy to defence and infrastructure industries.Calls for proposalsCMGD Initiative contributions fundingClosed for applicationsFunding available:$2.8 million, with up to $500,000 per project for eligible geoscience data projects. Federal funding per project cannot exceed 75% of the total project cost.Type of funding:Non-repayable contributionsApplication deadline:11:59 p.m. PDT, on May 31, 2024Program timeframe:April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2027Learn moreBackground on the CMGD InitiativeThe Geological Survey of Canada-led CMGD Initiative supports Canada’s strategy to strengthen the supply chains of critical minerals needed for a sustainable, digital economy. The Initiative focuses on 6 critical minerals:cobaltcoppergraphitelithiumnickelrare earth elementsThese minerals are essential  to sustainable economic development in technology, energy, defence and  infrastructure. Many have a limited domestic supply and are at risk of supply  chain disruptions.Results of this Initiative  will provide baseline information for decisions related to resource development  and investment, while supporting the growth of Canadian industries reliant on  these critical minerals resources.Federal research and development (R&D)Between  March 2023 and March 2027, the CMGD Initiative is allocating $17.4 million  for R&D projects led by the Geological Survey of Canada to provide the  public with integrated datasets, knowledge and predictive models to accelerate  responsible critical minerals exploration and development in Canada. These  projects are being undertaken in collaboration with academic, industry and  provincial-territorial collaborators while providing essential training  opportunities for the next generation of geoscientists.Funded projectsThe following is a  list of projects that received contribution funding from the CMGD Initiative.
