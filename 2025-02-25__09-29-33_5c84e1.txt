Critical Minerals Geoscience and Data Initiative
Boosting Canada’s critical minerals potential through data and digital technologies
The Critical Minerals Geoscience and Data (CMGD) Initiative is dedicated to unlocking the sustainable development of Canada’s critical minerals resources by providing essential knowledge and data to support informed decision-making. This will be achieved by funding initiatives to enhance access to important data and generating insights on the geological potential of new critical minerals sources in Canada.
By harnessing the power of geoscience and data, we are paving the way for the responsible growth of industries reliant on these minerals, from technology and energy to defence and infrastructure industries.

Background on the CMGD Initiative
The Geological Survey of Canada-led CMGD Initiative supports Canada’s strategy to strengthen the supply chains of critical minerals needed for a sustainable, digital economy. The Initiative focuses on 6 critical minerals:
cobalt
copper
graphite
lithium
nickel
rare earth elements
These minerals are essential to sustainable economic development in technology, energy, defence and infrastructure. Many have a limited domestic supply and are at risk of supply chain disruptions.
Results of this Initiative will provide baseline information for decisions related to resource development and investment, while supporting the growth of Canadian industries reliant on these critical minerals resources.
Federal research and development (R&D)
Between March 2023 and March 2027, the CMGD Initiative is allocating $17.4 million for R&D projects led by the Geological Survey of Canada to provide the public with integrated datasets, knowledge and predictive models to accelerate responsible critical minerals exploration and development in Canada. These projects are being undertaken in collaboration with academic, industry and provincial-territorial collaborators while providing essential training opportunities for the next generation of geoscientists.
Funded projects
The following is a list of projects that received contribution funding from the CMGD Initiative. (Additional projects will be announced soon.)
Analysis of Archived Till Samples for Lithium and Other Critical Elements in Southwestern and West-Central New Brunswick
Organization: New Brunswick Geological Survey
Description: Measure lithium and other critical minerals in sediments deposited by glaciers to examine the soil (till) landscape of New Brunswick.

Amount funded: $108,300
Status: Launched in 2024, expected to be completed in 2025
Critical minerals: Lithium, cesium and tantalum
Location: New Brunswick
Extreme Fractionation of Late Silurian–Early Devonian Peralkaline Intrusions in the Northern Appalachians: Evaluation of Heavy Rare Earth Elements–Yttrium resource petrogenesis
Organization: New Brunswick Geological Survey
Description: Investigate the spatial and temporal relationships between different types of rare earth elements deposits and their surrounding terranes by mapping the deposits and using high-precision geochemistry methods to calculate the age of different components of deposits to understand how they form.
Amount funded: $155,000
Status: Launched in 2024, expected to be completed in 2026
Critical minerals: Rare earth elements
Location: New Brunswick
Critical Metal Potential of the Selwyn Sedimentary Basin: Primary and Secondary Geological and Geochemical Controls on Zinc and Vanadium Enrichment in Black Shales
Organizations: Northwest Territories Geological Survey and Government of the Northwest Territories
Description: Identify the factors that lead to the enrichment of zinc and vanadium in the Selwyn Basin and develop an improved mineral system model for zinc and vanadium mineralization in black shales.
