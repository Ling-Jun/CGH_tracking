Summary
The following measures are available to certain eligible property:
Accelerated investment incentive
– Providing an enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible property that is subject to the capital cost allowance (CCA) rules. In general, the incentive is made up of two elements:
applying the prescribed
CCA
rate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the year.
suspending the
CCA
half-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property).
Full expensing for manufacturers and processors
– Allowing businesses to immediately
write off the full cost of machinery and equipment
used for the manufacturing or processing of goods (Class 53).
Full expensing for clean energy investments
– Allowing businesses to immediately
write off the full cost of specified clean energy equipment
(Classes 43.1 and 43.2).
You must acquire the eligible property after November 20, 2018, and it must be available for use
before
2028 in order to qualify for the measures.
For more restrictions on property, see
Restrictions
.
A phase-out of the measures begins for eligible property that becomes available for use after 2023, though the
CCA
half-year rule effectively remains suspended for such property.
For more information, see
Application and phase-out
.
Accelerated investment incentive
The accelerated investment incentive (AII) measure provides an enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible property (EP).
The incentive's general rule does not apply to Classes 54, 55 and 56. It also does not apply to Classes 43.1, 43.2 and 53 (or to Class 43 in respect of property acquired after 2025 that would have been included in Class 53 if it had been acquired in 2025), as they benefit from the full expensing measures. For more information, see the
full expensing measures
.
The incentive's general rule is made up of two elements:
applying the prescribed
CCA
rate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the year
suspending the
CCA
half-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property)
As a result,
EP
that would be subject to the half-year rule, in essence, qualifies for an enhanced first-year allowance equal to
three times
the normal first-year deduction.
EP
not normally subject to the half-year rule (for example, a patent, franchise or limited-period licence) qualifies for
one-and-a-half times
the normal first-year deduction. For more information, see
Example 3
.
If the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of a class increases in a year by an investment in both
EP
and
non-eligible
property (NEP), and an amount (for example, a disposition) decreases the
UCC
of the class, you must first reduce the cost of
NEP
additions before reducing the cost of
EP
additions. For more information, see
Example 5
.
The incentive
applies
to property for which
CCA
is calculated on a:
declining-balance basis (for example, intangible property, included in Class 14.1)
straight-line depreciation (for example, leasehold improvements, patents, and limited period licences)
Effect of the enhanced first-year allowance in the following years
The
AII
does
not
change the total amount that you can deduct over the life of a property. By claiming a larger
CCA
deduction in the first year, you will have smaller
CCA
deductions in future years.
For classes where the
CCA
is calculated on a declining-balance basis, the incentive will automatically reduce the
UCC
available in respect of the property in subsequent years.
For
CCA
classes with straight-line depreciation, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in a year will not affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years, until such time as the
UCC
is fully exhausted.
Example 1
Where the calculated rate of a class with straight-line depreciation is 20% and there is only one property in the class, and it is an
EP
addition, you are entitled to deduct 30% (in other words, one-and-a-half times 20%) of the capital cost of the property in the first year, 20% in each of the second through fourth years and 10% (in other words, the remainder) in the fifth year.
Certain
resource-related
assets can depreciate based on unit of use. You can generally claim
CCA
based on the portion of the resources depleted in each year.
For properties depreciated on a
unit-of-use
basis, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in the first year will
not
affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years until such time as the
UCC
is fully exhausted.
Example 2
If you use 10% of a resource in the first year, you will be able to deduct 15% of its capital cost in the first year. After the first year, you will be eligible to deduct the cost in proportion to the amount of the resource depleted in each year to a maximum of 100% of the cost of the resource. The enhanced first-year allowance will reduce the amount of deduction you can claim in the final year.
Application and phase-out
You must acquire the
EP
after November 20, 2018, and it must be available for use before 2028 in order to qualify for the
AII
. A phase-out period begins for property that becomes available for use after 2023.
For
EP
that
would
normally
be subject to the half-year rule
(or an equivalent rule) and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is reduced to
two times
the normal first-year
CCA
deduction. The incentive effectively suspends the half-year rule (and equivalent rules). In essence, you can calculate
CCA
at the rate relevant to that class without applying the half-year rule.
For
EP
that
would not
normally
be subject to the half-year rule
(or an equivalent rule), and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is generally equal to
one-and-a-quarter times
the normal first-year
CCA
deduction.
You can claim the enhanced first-year allowance in respect of an
EP
only in the first tax year that the property becomes available for use.
As a result, as shown in examples 3 to 6, an enhanced first-year allowance of up to
three times
the normal first-year
CCA
deduction is available for property that would otherwise be subject to the half-year rule. The enhanced first-year allowance is reduced to
two times
the normal first-year
CCA
deduction in the 2024–2027 phase-out period as seen in
Example 6
.
Example 3
You acquire a Class 10 (30%) property for $300 in 2021, and it becomes available for use in that year. The property is eligible for the incentive and there is no
NEP
purchased in the year. There are no dispositions in the year.

Additional allowances and other deductions
The
AII
generally applies to additional allowances permitted under the Income Tax Regulations.
Under the incentive, you are able to claim additional allowances for property at a liquefied natural gas facility only against your income that is attributable to the liquefaction of natural gas at that facility.
You can't claim the
AII
for the additional allowance for mining property in Class 41.2. For more information, see
Additional restrictions
.
Enhanced first-year deductions in respect of Canadian development expense and Canadian oil and gas property expense
An enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible Canadian development expenses (CDE) or Canadian oil and gas property expenses (COGPE) incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028. These expenses are not subject to a
half-year
rule and, thus, qualify for an enhanced first-year deduction equal to one-and-a-half times the normal first-year deduction that would otherwise be available. The additional deduction begins to phase out for expenses incurred after 2023.
CDE
and
COGPE
are also not subject to the available for use rule.
Note
An accelerated
CDE
or
COGPE
does not include an expense that is a successored
CDE
or successored
COGPE
(in other words, expenses incurred by a predecessor corporation that a successor corporation is entitled to claim) or that is a cost in respect of a Canadian resource property you, or a partnership in which you are a member, acquired from a person or partnership with which you do not deal at arm's length.
Restrictions
Short tax years
Under the short tax-year rule, you must generally prorate the maximum amount of
CCA
you can claim if the tax year is less than 12 months. Property eligible for the incentive are also subject to the short tax year rules for
CCA
.
Rules to restrict CCA deduction
In certain situations, there are rules that can restrict a
CCA
deduction, or a loss in respect of such a deduction, that would otherwise be available.
Some of the rules that continue to apply include rules relating to:
limited partners
specified leasing properties
specified energy properties
rental properties
computer software tax shelter rules
limited recourse debt rules
This is not an exhaustive list.
Additional restrictions
Certain additional restrictions apply to
EP
. Under the
AII
, if you acquire property in respect to which a
CCA
deduction or a terminal loss has been claimed before you acquired it, it is only eligible for the incentive if both of the following conditions are met:
neither you nor a non-arm's length person previously owned the property
the property has not been transferred to you on a tax-deferred "rollover" basis
In other words, properties acquired in non-arm's length and roll-over transactions are not eligible for this incentive. They are considered
NEP
.
In addition, new rules may apply for certain property constructed over multiple tax years and transferred between non-arm's length parties before it is put in use. Where the capital cost of a single property includes expenditures incurred at different times, and you claim
CCA
or a terminal loss under special rules with respect to some of these expenditures, the single property will be deemed to be split into separate portions such that the portion for which no
CCA
or terminal loss has been claimed may be treated as a separate property in the event of a subsequent transfer of the property. As a result, the portion for which no
CCA
or terminal loss has been claimed may qualify as
AII
property.
Certain property is subject to the half-year rule but other property is excluded, therefore not all
NEP
are subject to the half-year rule. For more information on the half-year rule, see
Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance
.
Additionally, the
AII
does not apply for the additional allowance for mining property in Class 41.2. The allowance for mining property is currently being phased out.
Full expensing for manufacturing and processing machinery and equipment
Currently, certain machinery and equipment may qualify for a temporary accelerated
CCA
rate of 50% calculated on a declining-balance basis under Class 53. Such property qualifies if it is acquired after 2015 and before 2026 for use in Canada primarily in the manufacturing or processing of goods for sale or lease. This property would otherwise be included in Class 43 and qualify for a
CCA
rate of 30%.
If you acquire such property after November 20, 2018, and it becomes available for use before 2028, it is eligible for an enhanced first-year allowance. The enhanced allowance initially provides a 100% deduction in the year the property becomes available for use, with a phase-out for property that becomes available for use after 2023.
Full expensing effectively suspends the half-year rule for property eligible for this measure.

Full expensing for clean energy equipment
Specified clean energy equipment acquired after February 21, 1994, qualifies for an accelerated
CCA
rate of 30% calculated on a declining-balance basis under Class 43.1. You can depreciate equipment acquired after February 22, 2005, and before 2025, that would otherwise be eligible for Class 43.1 (subject to certain limited exceptions), at an accelerated
CCA
rate of 50% under Class 43.2. Many of these assets would otherwise depreciate at lower rates of 4%, 8% or 20%.
If you acquire property after November 20, 2018, and it becomes available for use before 2028, it is eligible for an enhanced first-year allowance. The enhanced allowance initially provides a 100% deduction, with a phase-out for property that becomes available for use after 2023.
Full expensing effectively suspends the half-year rule for property eligible for this measure.
