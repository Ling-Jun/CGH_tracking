In general, the incentive is made up of two elements:applying the prescribedCCArate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the year.suspending theCCAhalf-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property).Full expensing for manufacturers and processors– Allowing businesses to immediatelywrite off the full cost of machinery and equipmentused for the manufacturing or processing of goods (Class 53).Full expensing for clean energy investments– Allowing businesses to immediatelywrite off the full cost of specified clean energy equipment(Classes 43.1 and 43.2).You must acquire the eligible property after November 20, 2018, and it must be available for usebefore2028 in order to qualify for the measures.For more restrictions on property, seeRestrictions.A phase-out of the measures begins for eligible property that becomes available for use after 2023, though theCCAhalf-year rule effectively remains suspended for such property.For more information, seeApplication and phase-out.Accelerated investment incentiveThe accelerated investment incentive (AII) measure provides an enhanced first-year allowance for certain eligible property (EP).The incentive's general rule does not apply to Classes 54, 55 and 56. It also does not apply to Classes 43.1, 43.2 and 53 (or to Class 43 in respect of property acquired after 2025 that would have been included in Class 53 if it had been acquired in 2025), as they benefit from the full expensing measures. For more information, see thefull expensing measures.The incentive's general rule is made up of two elements:applying the prescribedCCArate for a class to up to one-and-a-half times the net addition to the class for the yearsuspending theCCAhalf-year rule (and equivalent rules for Canadian vessels and Class 13 property)As a result,EPthat would be subject to the half-year rule, in essence, qualifies for an enhanced first-year allowance equal tothree timesthe normal first-year deduction.EPnot normally subject to the half-year rule (for example, a patent, franchise or limited-period licence) qualifies forone-and-a-half timesthe normal first-year deduction. For more information, seeExample 3.If the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of a class increases in a year by an investment in bothEPandnon-eligibleproperty (NEP), and an amount (for example, a disposition) decreases theUCCof the class, you must first reduce the cost ofNEPadditions before reducing the cost ofEPadditions. For more information, seeExample 5.The incentiveappliesto property for whichCCAis calculated on a:declining-balance basis (for example, intangible property, included in Class 14.1)straight-line depreciation (for example, leasehold improvements, patents, and limited period licences)Effect of the enhanced first-year allowance in the following yearsTheAIIdoesnotchange the total amount that you can deduct over the life of a property. By claiming a largerCCAdeduction in the first year, you will have smallerCCAdeductions in future years.For classes where theCCAis calculated on a declining-balance basis, the incentive will automatically reduce theUCCavailable in respect of the property in subsequent years.ForCCAclasses with straight-line depreciation, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in a year will not affect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years, until such time as theUCCis fully exhausted.Example 1Where the calculated rate of a class with straight-line depreciation is 20% and there is only one property in the class, and it is anEPaddition, you are entitled to deduct 30% (in other words, one-and-a-half times 20%) of the capital cost of the property in the first year, 20% in each of the second through fourth years and 10% (in other words, the remainder) in the fifth year.Certainresource-relatedassets can depreciate based on unit of use. You can generally claimCCAbased on the portion of the resources depleted in each year.For properties depreciated on aunit-of-usebasis, your ability to claim the incentive in respect of a property in the first year willnotaffect the deduction available in respect of that property in any of the subsequent years until such time as theUCCis fully exhausted.Example 2If you use 10% of a resource in the first year, you will be able to deduct 15% of its capital cost in the first year. After the first year, you will be eligible to deduct the cost in proportion to the amount of the resource depleted in each year to a maximum of 100% of the cost of the resource. The enhanced first-year allowance will reduce the amount of deduction you can claim in the final year.Application and phase-outYou must acquire theEPafter November 20, 2018, and it must be available for use before 2028 in order to qualify for theAII. A phase-out period begins for property that becomes available for use after 2023.ForEPthatwouldnormallybe subject to the half-year rule(or an equivalent rule) and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is reduced totwo timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction. The incentive effectively suspends the half-year rule (and equivalent rules). In essence, you can calculateCCAat the rate relevant to that class without applying the half-year rule.ForEPthatwould notnormallybe subject to the half-year rule(or an equivalent rule), and that becomes available for use during the 2024–2027 phase-out period, the enhanced first-year allowance is generally equal toone-and-a-quarter timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction.You can claim the enhanced first-year allowance in respect of anEPonly in the first tax year that the property becomes available for use.As a result, as shown in examples 3 to 6, an enhanced first-year allowance of up tothree timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction is available for property that would otherwise be subject to the half-year rule. The enhanced first-year allowance is reduced totwo timesthe normal first-yearCCAdeduction in the 2024–2027 phase-out period as seen inExample 6.Example 3You acquire a Class 10 (30%) property for $300 in 2021, and it becomes available for use in that year.

For more information, seeAdditional restrictions.Enhanced first-year deductions in respect of Canadian development expense and Canadian oil and gas property expenseAn enhanced deduction also generally applies to eligible Canadian development expenses (CDE) or Canadian oil and gas property expenses (COGPE) incurred after November 20, 2018, and before 2028. These expenses are not subject to ahalf-yearrule and, thus, qualify for an enhanced first-year deduction equal to one-and-a-half times the normal first-year deduction that would otherwise be available. The additional deduction begins to phase out for expenses incurred after 2023.CDEandCOGPEare also not subject to the available for use rule.NoteAn acceleratedCDEorCOGPEdoes not include an expense that is a successoredCDEor successoredCOGPE(in other words, expenses incurred by a predecessor corporation that a successor corporation is entitled to claim) or that is a cost in respect of a Canadian resource property you, or a partnership in which you are a member, acquired from a person or partnership with which you do not deal at arm's length.RestrictionsShort tax yearsUnder the short tax-year rule, you must generally prorate the maximum amount ofCCAyou can claim if the tax year is less than 12 months. Property eligible for the incentive are also subject to the short tax year rules forCCA.Rules to restrict CCA deductionIn certain situations, there are rules that can restrict aCCAdeduction, or a loss in respect of such a deduction, that would otherwise be available.Some of the rules that continue to apply include rules relating to:limited partnersspecified leasing propertiesspecified energy propertiesrental propertiescomputer software tax shelter ruleslimited recourse debt rulesThis is not an exhaustive list.Additional restrictionsCertain additional restrictions apply toEP. Under theAII, if you acquire property in respect to which aCCAdeduction or a terminal loss has been claimed before you acquired it, it is only eligible for the incentive if both of the following conditions are met:neither you nor a non-arm's length person previously owned the propertythe property has not been transferred to you on a tax-deferred "rollover" basisIn other words, properties acquired in non-arm's length and roll-over transactions are not eligible for this incentive. They are consideredNEP.In addition, new rules may apply for certain property constructed over multiple tax years and transferred between non-arm's length parties before it is put in use. Where the capital cost of a single property includes expenditures incurred at different times, and you claimCCAor a terminal loss under special rules with respect to some of these expenditures, the single property will be deemed to be split into separate portions such that the portion for which noCCAor terminal loss has been claimed may be treated as a separate property in the event of a subsequent transfer of the property. As a result, the portion for which noCCAor terminal loss has been claimed may qualify asAIIproperty.Certain property is subject to the half-year rule but other property is excluded, therefore not allNEPare subject to the half-year rule. For more information on the half-year rule, seeIncome Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance.Additionally, theAIIdoes not apply for the additional allowance for mining property in Class 41.2. The allowance for mining property is currently being phased out.Full expensing for manufacturing and processing machinery and equipmentCurrently, certain machinery and equipment may qualify for a temporary acceleratedCCArate of 50% calculated on a declining-balance basis under Class 53. Such property qualifies if it is acquired after 2015 and before 2026 for use in Canada primarily in the manufacturing or processing of goods for sale or lease. This property would otherwise be included in Class 43 and qualify for aCCArate of 30%.If you acquire such property after November 20, 2018, and it becomes available for use before 2028, it is eligible for an enhanced first-year allowance. The enhanced allowance initially provides a 100% deduction in the year the property becomes available for use, with a phase-out for property that becomes available for use after 2023.Full expensing effectively suspends the half-year rule for property eligible for this measure.Table 1 – Phase-out of enhanced first-year allowanceYear property becomes available for useNormal first-year allowance (half-year rule)Enhanced first-year allowance for Class 53Enhanced first-year allowance for Class 43Footnote152018–202325100N/A20242575N/A20252575N/A202615555520271555552028 onward15N/AN/AThe rules relating to short tax years and restrictions described for the incentive apply in respect of this enhanced allowance.Full expensing for clean energy equipmentSpecified clean energy equipment acquired after February 21, 1994, qualifies for an acceleratedCCArate of 30% calculated on a declining-balance basis under Class 43.1. You can depreciate equipment acquired after February 22, 2005, and before 2025, that would otherwise be eligible for Class 43.1 (subject to certain limited exceptions), at an acceleratedCCArate of 50% under Class 43.2. Many of these assets would otherwise depreciate at lower rates of 4%, 8% or 20%.If you acquire property after November 20, 2018, and it becomes available for use before 2028, it is eligible for an enhanced first-year allowance. The enhanced allowance initially provides a 100% deduction, with a phase-out for property that becomes available for use after 2023.Full expensing effectively suspends the half-year rule for property eligible for this measure.Table 2 – Phase-out of enhanced first-year allowanceYear property becomes available for useNormal first-year allowance (half-year rule) for Class 43.1Normal first-year allowance (half-year rule) for Class 43.2Enhanced first-year allowance2018–202315251002024152575202515N/A75202615N/A55202715N/A552028 onward15N/AN/AThe rules relating to short tax years and restrictions described for the incentive apply in respect of this enhanced allowance.Footnote 15The full expensing treatment only applies to Class 43 properties if they were acquired after 2025 and would otherwise be included in Class 53 if they were acquired in 2025.Return to footnote15referrerForms and publicationsGuide T4002, Self-employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing IncomeGuide T4036, Rental IncomeGuide T4068, Guide for the Partnership Information Return (T5013 Forms)Guide T4012, T2 Corporation – Income Tax GuidePage detailsDate modified:2024-08-19
