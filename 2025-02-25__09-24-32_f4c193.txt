Release of funds
Intellectual property
Adjudication
Mitacs invoices a partner organization upon submission of their Accelerate proposal. Upon receipt of the partner’s contribution, Mitacs forwards the research award to the Canadian academic institution. No funds will be released to the academic institution until the invoice has been paid and the proposal is approved. Mitacs has no control over when funds are administered by the academic institution. If you have questions about your Accelerate award after Mitacs has released funds, contact your academic institution’s Office of Research Services (or equivalent).
Mitacs’ policy is to take no position and claims no intellectual property (IP) from projects it funds. All Mitacs Accelerate participants are bound by the IP terms of the academic institution where the intern is enrolled. IP is left to be shared between the academic institution, its researchers, and the partner organization, according to the IP rules of the academic institution, unless a separate agreement is negotiated.
The following universities have developed their own IP terms for Mitacs projects:
Brock University
Concordia University
McGill University
Simon Fraser University
University of Alberta
University of Calgary
University of Ottawa
University of Victoria
Note that these IP agreements may not apply to joint applications with other funding organizations.
External reviewers for internship proposals receive the following questions to guide their assessment of the proposal:
Mitacs Accelerate supports research-based internships. Does the proposed project qualify as research in its discipline?
Is the project appropriate for the academic degree level of the intern(s)?
Are the objectives clear?
Is the methodology appropriate to achieve the objectives?
Is the timeline realistic?
Other comments and suggestions for the applicants. For example, is there prior work that should be considered by the researchers?
Confidential comments for Mitacs:
Will the research work potentially have adverse effects on the environment? Do you recommend that an additional environmental impact review be conducted?
Proposals for large and long-term projects may sometimes involve significant technical or scientific uncertainties, complex project management plans, or highly structured intern recruitment, supervision, and training plans. In these situations, Mitacs reserves the right to hold a review meeting between applicants and reviewers to support the assessment of such proposals before arriving at a final funding decision. The need for such a review meeting will be determined as part of the review process, and applicants will be notified as soon as possible if a review meeting needs to be scheduled.
Responsibilities
The following steps outline the responsibilities of each Mitacs Accelerate participant before, during, and after their project. For projects with multiple internships, each intern is responsible for their individual steps.

FAQs
Before You Apply
When You Apply
After You Apply
During Your Internship
Are Recent Graduates eligible?
Recent college and university graduates (any level) are eligible, at the discretion of the academic institution.
Must have status at a Canadian academic institution
Check with your institution to find out what status(es) are available for recent grads
Internship must start within two years of graduation
Normally eligible for one 4-6-month internship but may do up to three depending on the needs of the project and the discretion of the academic institution
All program expectations remain the same: the intern must have an academic supervisor and split their time between the academic institution and the partner organization
Recent Graduates are eligible for standard Accelerate and Accelerate Entrepreneur
International travel may be limited by circumstances external to Mitacs for some individuals (e.g., recent graduates may not be able to travel internationally for the project due to visa requirements for non-students).
Can a partner organization contribute more than $7,500 per internship?
Yes. Partner organizations are welcome to contribute additional funding but Mitacs will not provide any additional funding outside of the standard award. [This additional partner funding should be included in the application budget and the anticipated use of funds (e.g., stipend/salary top-up, specialized equipment).] Top-up funds must be received at Mitacs at the same time as the minimum contribution and will be added to the award and forwarded to the academic institution.
Can I hold both an Accelerate and other grants at the same time?
Mitacs does not have any restrictions on its recipients holding other grants.
You are responsible to determine if your other grants have such restrictions prior to applying to Accelerate.
Can Mitacs allow for virtual interaction with partner organizations and academic institutions?
Direct interaction and supervision by the partner organization for a portion of the internship is a key feature of Mitacs’s Accelerate, BSI and Elevate programs. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mitacs required that interns spend time on site at the partner organization to benefit from this interaction and supervision. Now that the technology to enable virtual work has greatly improved and many workplaces have hybrid or fully virtual operations, Mitacs will continue to allow interaction with the partner organization in our internship programs to take place virtually as well as in person.
When writing their application, participants should focus on the nature of the interaction with the partner and plan for high-quality interaction and supervision regardless of whether it takes place in person, virtually or hybrid. Mitacs still encourages on-site interaction at the partner when it is logistically feasible.
* Note that Globalink are international mobility programs. For this reason, travel and time spent on site with collaborators are still required in these programs.
Can Mitacs help international students with immigration?
International students are eligible to participate in Accelerate, however, Mitacs cannot give specific immigration advice. We recommend that international students check with the international office at their academic institution, or contact a registered immigration specialist or consultant for advice.
How does the funding work?
Internships are 4–6-month units of a research project, valued at $15K per unit, with $7,500 from both the partner organization and Mitacs, to support post-secondary research projects. Funds flow through the academic institution with a stipend to the student at a minimum of $10K, with up to $5K to support research costs. Please refer to the Funding section for an illustrated explanation.
If a student is interested in doing an internship, can Mitacs help them find a partner organization?
Mitacs cannot find partner organizations for individual interns. For tips on finding a partner organization, view the
Research Partnerships 101 webinar
, talk to your academic supervisor, or visit the
Researchers Wanted page.
Is the financial contribution of the partner organization subject to taxes?
Please note that the financial contribution of organizations is subject to applicable Goods and Services Tax (GST), Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) and/or Quebec Sales Tax (QST) (Collectively the value added tax or VAT).
What constitutes a Conflict of Interest?
Please refer to
Mitacs Conflict of Interest Policy
for more details. If there is a conflict of interest, please discuss with your Mitacs Advisor before applying.
What is needed to apply for Mitacs Accelerate projects?
In order to apply for Mitacs Accelerate projects, you would need both an academic partner and a non-academic partner (e.g. a partner organization such as a for-profit or not-for-profit corporation) in Canada who would also be benefiting from the research. In addition to a non-academic partner in Canada, your project may optionally include a non-academic partner abroad.
Load More
If an Accelerate internship has been approved, when will the funds be available?
Mitacs forwards Accelerate funds to the student’s academic institution only after it has received the contribution from the student’s partner organization. Please allow two weeks for processing upon receipt of this contribution. Interns travelling to Canada should be aware that their funding may not be available until they arrive in Canada. Mitacs recommends that interns contact their Canadian host institution’s Office of Research Services prior to the project to determine when they can access funds.
Can a student do an Accelerate internship outside of Canada?
All Accelerate internships must include a partner organization in Canada (for-profit or not-for-profit corporation,
hospital
or municipality) and may optionally include a partner organization(s) abroad. Interns must have student, postdoc or recent
grad
status at an eligible Canadian post-secondary institution and must interaction with the Canadian partner organization. If applicable, they may also travel to interact with an international partner organization
.
When must the partner contribution be received at Mitacs?
Invoices must be paid in full to Mitacs prior to any internship funds being sent by Mitacs to the university. Please note that all partner funds must be sent directly to Mitacs and not to the university. The funds must be received in advance of the internship start date.
Can I extend my project?
Certain requirements must be met to be eligible to request a project extension. Please see the criteria below and contact your Mitacs Advisor for next steps. If your case does not meet the criteria below, you may submit a new project funding application.
1. Applicants who have an approved Mitacs Accelerate project may apply for a funding extension of 1 internship unit (IU) per intern — to a maximum of 10 IUs per project. Applications for an extension can be submitted once the internship(s) being extended is/are at least 75% through their original timeline. The funding extension shall be used to:
• Complete the existing project in cases where the project has experienced delays due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., lack of access to facilities due to COVID-19, sample delays due to transportation, seasonal delays in fieldwork, etc.)
• Broaden the scope of the project (e.g., conducting additional tests, including additional samples, adding data sources for analysis, etc.)
• In either case, the request cannot be used to add new objectives or change existing project objectives.
2. Extensions must be requested within 4 months from when the intern completed their last IU on the project. In cases where a new intern is being added to the project, the request must be submitted within 4 months from the end of the last IU completed on the project.
3. If the extensions will be used to add a new intern to the project, a New Intern Profile form and the new intern’s CV will be required along with this completed form.
4. All interns must remain eligible (including respecting maximum internship allocation) to hold Mitacs internships for the duration of the extension period.
5. No discounts or enhanced leveraging options are available to fund the extension internships. Only standard funding models may apply, regardless of the funding models for the original project. Partner organizations are required to contribute additional funds for the extension period.
What happens if a project needs to be cancelled?
Mitacs Accelerate internships require the active participation of the intern, professor, and partner organization. All participants should attempt to fulfill their project obligations.If all parties are in agreement, a project or individual internship may be terminated. If one party wants to cancel the internship without other parties’ agreement, they must first notify them in writing and allow 30 days for resolution of outstanding issues.
Any funds remaining after a cancelled internship must be returned to Mitacs. For more information, please refer to the downloadable General Mitacs Terms, Conditions & Policies zip file found under How To Apply.
What if it’s been more than 30 days and the invitation for the Exit Survey has not been received?
Participants should check their spam or junk folder. If they still haven’t received it, they should contact evaluation@mitacs.ca.
What is the Mid-Term survey?
The Mid-Term surveys are mid-term checks that are sent to Accelerate Interns & the partner organizations at the midpoint of each internship unit on the project, to check-in and ensure that the internship started as originally proposed, to address any issues, and to offer an opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback to the Accelerate team during the internship.
When will the link to complete the Exit Survey be provided?
Participants should receive an invitation within the 30 days following the completion of their internship/fellowship.
