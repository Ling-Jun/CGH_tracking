The Green Shipping Corridor Program
From:
Transport Canada
The Green Shipping Corridor Program (GSCP) provides funding for projects that contribute to the establishment of green shipping corridors and the decarbonization of the marine sector along the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence Seaway as well as Canada’s East and West Coasts by:
removing barriers to the adoption of emission reducing equipment and infrastructure
incentivizing industry-led partnerships and investments to accelerate the adoption of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reduction technologies and infrastructure
de-risking investments to increase the technology-readiness level of low carbon and zero-emission ship technology and marine fuels for the domestic vessel fleet
building capacity among Canadian vessel owner/operators with respect to their ability to identify, plan and implement next generation low carbon and zero-emission ship technology and marine fuels into their vessel operations
GSCP allocates funding through two streams that have been designed to contribute to the achievement of program objectives by supporting projects focused on the implementation of clean technologies along the shipping value chain on shore and on vessels.
Clean Ports Stream
The Clean Ports Stream will provide $127.2M in contribution funding over four years between 2024-25 to 2027-28 for projects targeting onshore equipment and infrastructure investments at ports and terminals, (for example, commercially available shore power, electrification of port equipment, vessel charging and clean fuel infrastructure), and funding to ports to establish/augment incentive programs to help attract clean vessels.
Clean Vessel Demonstration Stream
The Clean Vessel Demonstration Stream will provide $22.5M in grant and contribution funding over five years from 2023-24 to 2027-28 for projects with the goal of increasing the technology readiness of leading-edge low- and zero-emission vessel technologies; addressing potential barriers to the deployment of clean vessel innovations in Canada; and building Canadian industry's capacity to adopt decarbonization solutions for their vessels.
