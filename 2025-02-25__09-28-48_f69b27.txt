Critical Minerals Infrastructure FundAdvancing clean energy and transportation infrastructure projectsThe Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF) will provide up to $1.5 billion in federal funding until 2030 for clean energy and transportation infrastructure projects necessary to enable the sustainable development and expansion of critical minerals in Canada. The CMIF currently offers two avenues for support:Grants to support Indigenous engagement, participation and capacity building related to infrastructure projects that would enable critical minerals developmentContribution funding for preconstruction activities and shovel-ready infrastructure projectsIndigenous Grants ProgramClosed for applicationsFunding  available:The first call for proposals closed on December 31, 2024 and will provide up to $3.5 million in grant funding to eligible engagement projects.Status:This call for proposalsis closed.
