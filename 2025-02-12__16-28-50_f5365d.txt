Economic Development Initiative
The Economic Development Initiative (EDI) provides financial support to projects that encourage economic diversification, business development, innovation, partnerships and increased support for small- and medium-sized enterprises in official language minority communities (OLMCs).
In 2018, the Government of Canada announced its Action Plan for Official Languages 2018-2023: Investing in Our Future. The Plan comes with a budget of $2.7 billion over 5 years and is allocated among 15 federal departments and agencies. CanNor is responsible for delivering EDI funding across Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.
Every year, the Agency, through the EDI, invests in projects that help develop capacity, expertise and partnerships. All projects are for economic development of businesses and communities, and the sustainable growth of Francophone communities across the territories.
How to apply
If you have a project idea and would like to submit an application for funding under the EDI, please fill out the Application Form.
Upon receipt, projects submitted are reviewed by regional economic development officers, and applicants may be invited to submit a full application. At that time, a generic application and any program specific applications may be provided.
