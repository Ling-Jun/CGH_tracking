Contact PacifiCan to ask questions about this initiative or discuss eligibility. 
The Regional Quantum Initiative is part of the national Regional Economic Growth through Innovation program.
Quantum science is the study, manipulation and control of systems at the atomic and subatomic level. It can lead to transformative technologies in fields such as computing, sensors, secure communications and advanced materials development.
Quantum technology is at the leading edge of science and innovation, with enormous potential for commercialization.
In addition to helping transform the economy, quantum technologies will have a wide range of benefits for Canadians, including:
the design and delivery of new medicines, vaccines and next-generation batteries
more efficient and secure supply chains and digital communication
greener products and new approaches to model, track and forecast climate change
As one of four regional hubs of Canadian expertise in quantum technologies, B.C. is well positioned to transform research into products and processes.
