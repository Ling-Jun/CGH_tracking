Green Freight Program Applicant’s Guide: Stream 1IntroductionEligibility criteriaFunding activitiesHow to applyContact us for helpWe listened to you!As a direct result of industry feedback, the Green Freight Program has made several modifications to Stream 1 that came into effect April 1, 2024. The goal is to streamline the application process, as well as respond to industry needs, while maintaining the highest fiscal responsibility.IntroductionStream 1 of the Program provides grant funding up to a maximum of $250,000 per Applicant towards Third-Party Fleet Energy Assessments and Truck/Trailer Equipment Retrofits. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) has established a list of approved retrofit devices, of which a percentage of the cost are eligible for a grant.This stream aims to increase the knowledge and capacity of the on-road freight transportation sector to adopt energy efficiency measures tailored to operational needs by providing financial support. Stream 1 of the Program is accepting applications through a continuous intake process. Only applications that meet the Program’s requirements as outlined in this Guide will receive a grant on a first come, first served basis.Eligibility criteriaEligible ApplicantsTo be eligible for a grant, Applicants must meet the following two (2) requirements:Only entities operating in Canada are eligible to apply.

Funding under Stream 1 is allocated per fiscal year, starting from April 1st of a given year and ending on March 31st of the following year. Upon notice of three months posted on this website, Natural Resources Canada may reallocate the maximum amount available for Stream 1 per fiscal year.a) Third-Party Fleet Energy Assessment GrantApplicants can hire a third-party energy assessment company of their choosing to complete the Fleet Energy Assessment; however, the assessmentmust meet the minimum requirementsinNRCan’s Fleet Energy Assessment Checklist. Third-party fleet energy assessments will also require a written explanation to support Sections 3 and 4 of the assessment. This written explanation should clearly outline why the technology is being recommended and how the analysis was conducted.The following table lists the types of assessments that will be eligible to receive a grant.Assessment TypeCriteriaGrant AmountBasic Third-Party AssessmentThe Third-Party Assessment must meet criteria for a Basic Fleet Assessment outlined in NRCan’s Fleet Energy Assessment Checklist. This assessment explores fleet retrofits and small-scale logistical best practice projects.50% of the cost up to a maximum $20,000Enhanced Third-Party AssessmentThe Third-Party Assessment must meet criteria for the Enhanced Fleet Assessment outlined in NRCan’s Fleet Energy Assessment Checklist. Enhanced Third-Party Assessments explore complex and large-scale engine repower, alternative fuel truck purchase and logistical best-practice projects.50% of the cost up to $40,000b) Truck/Trailer Equipment Retrofit GrantStream 1 provides funding for the purchase and installation of new fuel-saving equipment retrofits for trucks and trailerscompleted on or after December 12, 2022.IMPORTANT: To be eligible for the Truck/Trailer Equipment Retrofit Grant, the Applicant’s fleetmustundergo a Fleet Energy Assessmentbeforethey purchase any new fuel-saving device(s) and the assessmentmustanalyze and recommend the device(s) that the Applicant plans to purchase.The Applicant can independently conduct and submit aself-assessmentat no additional cost or submit anassessment that was conducted by a third-party energy assessoron or after January 1, 2019, as long as the assessment meet the Basic Fleet Assessment criteria outlined inNRCan’s Fleet Energy Assessment Checklist.Please note, self-fleet energy assessments are not eligible for reimbursement.Stream 1 will provide funding towards the purchase and installation of a set list for trucks and trailers new fuel-saving devices. The tables below list the devices that are eligible for a grant up to a maximum cost per device.Aerodynamics RetrofitsDeviceDescriptionGrant amountBoat Tail / Trailer Rear DeviceA rear device that reduces the wake field following the trailer, which can affect air some distance beyond the back of the trailer.50% up to max of $2,500 per deviceTrailer Top and Side KitsA device attached on the top and underside of a trailer to reduce air flow and turbulence for weather and wind-sensitive loads.50% up to max of $1,000 per deviceTrailer Fairings / Side SkirtA device installed on the underside of a trailer to address aerodynamic drag on trailers to reduce air flow by preventing wind from ducking in underneath.50% up to max of $2,500 per deviceTrailer Underbody FairingA device attached underside of a trailer to support aerodynamic drag especially when ambient winds are not aligned with the tractor and trailer.
