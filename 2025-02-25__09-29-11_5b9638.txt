Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration ProgramAdvancing the commercial readiness of emerging mineral processing operations or technologiesThe Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration (CMRDD) program  is providing $192.1 million in federal funding to support the development of innovative processing technologies for the critical minerals industry, which will help advance Canadian mining projects toward production and further develop domestic critical minerals value chains.CMRDD is administered through two funding streams:Federal research and development projectsClosed for applicationsFunds federal research and development (R&D) projects that are aligned with industry needs and supported by several of Canada’s federal research facilitiesProject applications from the most recentexpression of interestintake process are currently in review. Funded projects will be announced in spring 2024.Contribution fundingClosed for applicationsFunds to advance technological solutions for the production of critical minerals at several stages, such as processing, downstream product manufacturing and recyclingProject applications from the most recentcall for proposalsare currently in review. Funded projects will be announced in spring 2024.BackgroundWithin each funding stream, allocations will be made in phases as funding becomes available. The following provides a breakdown of budget allocations to date:Federal research and developmentBetween 2022 and 2024, $35.7 million was allocated to 30 R&D projects undertaken by federal research laboratories and focused on battery minerals, mining value from waste, clean tech and other value chains.Learn more about Canada’s R&D projects.The most recent budget will allocate up to $44.4 million to federal R&D laboratories for the development of new or improved technologies that support the advancement of critical mineral value chains. In order to better align federal R&D with industry needs, industry and academia were invited to submit an expression of interest to collaborate with federal research laboratories on upstream and midstream projects at low to mid technology readiness levels (TRL) 2–5 with the capacity to:make significant positive impacts on the critical minerals industry in Canadahelp propel projects into the pilot and demonstration (pre-commercialization) phase of developmentStatus:Thiscall for applicationsis closed. A list of funded projects will be announced soon.Contribution fundingBetween 2022 and 2025, $22.2 million in contribution funding was allocated to pilot plant and demonstration projects. In total, eight projects were funded to validate the feasibility and viability of processing technologies. See the list of funded projects below.The most recent call for proposals will allocate up to $40 million to support midstream projects at technology readiness levels 6–8. This will help to advance the commercial readiness of emerging processing technologies and provide raw material inputs for use in:batteries and permanent magnetsadvanced manufacturing supply chainssemiconductorsinformation and communication technologiescritical infrastructure value chains for commercializationStatus:Thiscall for applicationsis closed. Funded projects will be announced and listed below.Funded ProjectsThe following is a list of projects that received contribution funding from the CMRDD program (additional projects will be announced soon). These projects help to advance production of zero-emission vehicle batteries and other clean technologies such as the manufacturing of permanent magnets.Kingston Demonstration Plant – Extended OperationsOrganization:Cyclic Materials Inc.Description:Operate a demonstration plant that produces high-purity mixed rare earth  oxide (MREO) and a cobalt/nickel mixed hydroxide product (MHP) from mixed feed  sources using proprietary Cyclic Materials Inc. physical (spoke) and hydrometallurgical (hub)  processes, validating operating conditions to support future scale and  commercial operations.Amount funded:$4,893,125Status:Launching in 2024; expected to be completed by 2027Critical Mineral:Rare earth elements, cobalt, nickelLocation:Kingston, OntarioCanadian Brine to Battery Chemicals: Simplified, Lower Cost, More SustainableOrganization:Saltworks Technologies Inc.Description:Process geological lithium brines using Saltwork’s novel technologies to  produce lithium battery precursors through a process that reduces costs and  energy while increasing lithium yield.Amount funded:$4,937,500Status:Launching in 2024; expected to be completed by 2027Critical Mineral:LithiumLocation:Richmond, British ColumbiaElectrolysis for lithium production and recyclingOrganization:NORAM Electrolysis Systems Inc.
