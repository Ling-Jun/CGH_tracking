Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration Program
Advancing the commercial readiness of emerging mineral processing operations or technologies
The Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration (CMRDD) program  is providing $192.1 million in federal funding to support the development of innovative processing technologies for the critical minerals industry, which will help advance Canadian mining projects toward production and further develop domestic critical minerals value chains.
CMRDD is administered through two funding streams:
Federal research and development projects
Closed for applications
Funds federal research and development (R&D) projects that are aligned with industry needs and supported by several of Canada’s federal research facilities
Project applications from the most recent
expression of interest
intake process are currently in review. Funded projects will be announced in spring 2024.
Contribution funding
Closed for applications
Funds to advance technological solutions for the production of critical minerals at several stages, such as processing, downstream product manufacturing and recycling
Project applications from the most recent
call for proposals
are currently in review. Funded projects will be announced in spring 2024.
Background
Within each funding stream, allocations will be made in phases as funding becomes available. The following provides a breakdown of budget allocations to date:
Federal research and development
Between 2022 and 2024, $35.7 million was allocated to 30 R&D projects undertaken by federal research laboratories and focused on battery minerals, mining value from waste, clean tech and other value chains.

.
The most recent budget will allocate up to $44.4 million to federal R&D laboratories for the development of new or improved technologies that support the advancement of critical mineral value chains. In order to better align federal R&D with industry needs, industry and academia were invited to submit an expression of interest to collaborate with federal research laboratories on upstream and midstream projects at low to mid technology readiness levels (TRL) 2–5 with the capacity to:
make significant positive impacts on the critical minerals industry in Canada
help propel projects into the pilot and demonstration (pre-commercialization) phase of development
Status:
This
call for applications
is closed. A list of funded projects will be announced soon.
Contribution funding
Between 2022 and 2025, $22.2 million in contribution funding was allocated to pilot plant and demonstration projects. In total, eight projects were funded to validate the feasibility and viability of processing technologies. See the list of funded projects below.
The most recent call for proposals will allocate up to $40 million to support midstream projects at technology readiness levels 6–8. This will help to advance the commercial readiness of emerging processing technologies and provide raw material inputs for use in:
batteries and permanent magnets
advanced manufacturing supply chains
semiconductors
information and communication technologies
critical infrastructure value chains for commercialization
Status:
This
call for applications
is closed. Funded projects will be announced and listed below.
